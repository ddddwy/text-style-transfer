you know , i 'm starting to think hermione was right about her -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead -- she 's a right old fraud
yeah , said harry , looking at his own watch
it-was now two o'clock
wish she 'd hurry up
parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride
she says i 've got all the makings of a true seer , she informed harry and ron
i saw loads of stuff
well , good luckshe hurried off down the spiral staircase toward lavender
ronald weasley , said the familiar , misty voice from over their heads
ron grimaced at harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight
harry was now the only person left to be tested
he settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall , listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window , his mind across the grounds with hagrid
finally , after about twenty minutes , ron 's large feet reappeared on the ladder
how 'd it go ? harry asked him , standing up
rubbish , said ron
could n't see a thing , so i made some stuff up
do n't think she was convinced , though
meet you in the common room , harry muttered as professor trelawney 's voice called , harry potterthe tower room was hotter than ever before ; the curtains were closed , the fire was alight , and the usual sickly scent made harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where professor trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball
good day , my dear , she said softly
if you would kindly gaze into the orb
take your time , now
then tell me what you see within it
harry bent over the crystal ball and stared , stared as hard as he could , willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog , but nothing happened
well ? professor trelawney prompted delicately
what do you see ? the heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them
he thought of what ron had just said , and decided to pretend
er -- said harry , a dark shape
what does it resemble ? whispered professor trelawney
harry cast his mind around and it landed on buckbeak
a hippogriff , he said firmly
indeed whispered professor trelawney , scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees
my boy , you may well be seeing the outcome of poor hagrid 's trouble with the ministry of magic look closer
does the hippogriff appear to
have its head ? yes , said harry firmly
are you sure ? professor trelawney urged him
are you quite sure , dear ? you do n't see it writhing on the ground , perhaps , and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it ? no said harry , starting to feel slightly sick
no blood ? no weeping hagrid ? no said harry again , wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat
it looks fine , it 's - - flying away
professor trelawney sighed
well , dear , i think we 'll leave it there
a little disappointing
but i 'm sure you did your best
relieved , harry got up , picked up his bag and turned to go , but then a loud , harsh voice spoke behind him
it will happen tonight
harry wheeled around
professor trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair ; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging
s -- sorry ? said harry
but professor trelawney did n't seem to hear him
her eyes started to roll
harry sat there in a panic
she looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure
he hesitated , thinking of running to the hospital wing -- and then professor trelawney spoke again , in the same harsh voice , quite unlike her own : the dark lord lies alone and friendless , abandoned by his followers
his servant has been chained these twelve years
tonight , before midnight
the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master
the dark lord will rise again with his servants aid , greater and more terrible than ever he was
will set ou
professor trelawney 's head fell forward onto her chest
she made a grunting sort of noise
harry sat there , staring at her
then , quite suddenly , professor trelawney 's head snapped up again
i 'm so sorry , dear boy , she said dreamily , the heat of the day , you know
i drifted off for a moment
harry sat there , staring at her
is there anything wrong , my dear ? you -- you just told me that the -- the dark lord 's going to rise again
that his servant 's going to go back to him
professor trelawney looked thoroughly startled
the dark lord ? he-who-must-not-be-named ? my dear boy , that 's hardly something to joke about
rise again , indeed -- , 'but you just said it you
said the dark lord -- i think you must have dozed off too , dear said professor trelawney
i would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched as thatharry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase , wondering
had he just heard professor trelawney make a real prediction ? or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test ? five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to gryffindor tower , professor trelawney 's words still resounding in his head
people were striding past him in the opposite direction , laughing and joking , heading for the grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom ; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room , it was almost deserted
over in the corner , however , sat ron and hermione
professor trelawney , harry panted , just told me -- but he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces
buckbeak lost , said ron weakly
hagrid 's just sent this
hagrid 's note was dry this time , no tears had splattered it , yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible
they 're going to execute at sunset
nothing you can do
do n't come down
i do n't want you to see it
hagridwe 've got to go , said harry at once
he ca n't just sit there on his own , waiting for the executionersunset , though , said ron , who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way
we 'd never be allowed
specially you , harry
harry sank his head into his hands , thinking
if we only had the invisibility cloak
where is it ? said hermione
harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed witch
if snape sees me anywhere near there again , i 'm in serious trouble , he finished
that 's true , said hermione , getting to her feet
if he sees you
how do you open the witch 's hump again ? you -- you tap it and say , 'dissendium , ' said harry
but -- hermione did n't wait for the rest of his sentence ; she strode across the room , pushed open the fat lady 's portrait and vanished from sight
she has n't gone to get it ? ron said , staring after her
hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes
hermione , i do n't know what 's gotten , into you lately said ron , astounded
first you hit malfoy , then you walk out on professor trelawney -- hermione looked rather flattered
they went down to dinner with everybody else , but did not return to gryffindor tower afterward
harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of his robes ; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump
they skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall , listening , until they were sure it was deserted
they heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming
hermione poked her head around the door
okay , she whispered , no one there -- cloak on -- walking very close together so that nobody would see them , they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak , then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds
the sun was already sinking behind the forbidden forest , gilding the top branches of the trees
they reached hagrid 's cabin and knocked
he was a minute in answering , and when he did , he looked all around for his visitor , pale-faced and trembling
it 's us , harry hissed
we 're wearing the invisibility cloak
let us in and we can take it off
yeh shouldn 've come hagrid whispered , but he stood back , and they stepped inside
hagrid shut the door quickly and harry pulled off the cloak
hagrid was not crying , nor did he throw himself upon their necks
he looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do
this helplessness was worse to watch than tears
wan ' some tea ? he said
his great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle
where 's buckbeak , hagrid ? said hermione hesitantly
i -- i took him outside , said hagrid , spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug
he 's tethered in me pumpkin patch
thought he oughta see the trees an ' -- an ' smell fresh air -- beforehagrid 's hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor
i 'll do it , hagrid , said hermione quickly , hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess
there 's another one in the cupboard , hagrid said , sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve
harry glanced at ron , who looked back hopelessly
is n't there anything anyone can do , hagrid ? harry asked fiercely , sitting down next to him
dumbledore -- he 's tried , said hagrid
he 's got no power ter overrule the committee
he told 'em buckbeak 's all right , but they 're scared
yeh know what lucius malfoy 's like
threatened 'em , i expect
an ' the executioner , macnair , he 's an old pal o ' malfoy 's
but it 'll be quick an ' clean
an ' i 'll be beside him
his eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort
dumbledore 's gon na come down while it -- while it happens
wrote me this mornin
said he wants ter -- ter be with me
great man , dumbledore
hermione , who had been rummaging in hagrid 's cupboard for another milk jug , let out a small , quickly stifled sob
she straightened up with the new jug in her hands , fighting back tears
we 'll stay with you too , hagrid , she began , but hagrid shook his shaggy head
yeh 're ter go back up ter the castle
i told yeh , i don ' wan ' yeh watchin
an ' yeh shouldn ' be down here anyway
if fudge an ' dumbledore catch yeh out without permission , harry , yeh 'll be in big trouble
silent tears were now streaming down hermione 's face , but she hid them from hagrid , bustling around making tea
then , as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug , she let out a shriek
ron , i do n't believe it -- it 's scabbersron gaped at her
what are you talking about ? hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down
with a frantic squeak , and much scrambling to get back inside , scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table
scabbers said ron blankly
scabbers , what are you doing here ? he grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light
scabbers looked dreadful
he was thinner than ever , large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches , and he writhed in ron 's hands as though desperate to free himselfit 's okay , scabbers said ron
no cats there 's nothing here to hurt youhagrid suddenly stood up , his eyes fixed on the window
his normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment
harry , ron , and hermione whipped around
a group of men was walking down the distant castle steps
in front was albus dumbledore , his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun
next to him trotted cornelius fudge
behind them came the feeble old committee member and the executioner , macnair
yeh got ta go , said hagrid
every inch of him was trembling
they mustn ' find yeh here
ron stuffed scabbers into his pocket and hermione picked up the cloak
i 'll let yeh out the back way , said hagrid
they followed him to the door into his back garden
harry felt strangely unreal , and even more so when he saw buckbeak a few yards away , tethered to a tree behind hagrid 's pumpkin patch
buckbeak seemed to know something was happening
he turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously
it 's okay , beaky , said hagrid softly
he turned to harry , ron , and hermione
go on , he said
but they did n't move
hagrid , we ca n't -- we 'll tell them what really happened -- they ca n't kill him -- go said hagrid fiercely
it 's bad enough without you lot in trouble an ' allthey had no choice
as hermione threw the cloak over harry and ron , they heard voices at the front of the cabin
hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight
go quick , he said hoarsely
and he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door
slowly , in a kind of horrified trance , harry , ron , and hermione set off silently around hagrid 's house
as they reached the other side , the front door closed with a sharp snap
please , let 's hurry , hermione whispered
i ca n't stand it , i ca n't bear it
they started up the sloping lawn toward the castle
the sun was sinking fast now ; the sky had turned to a clear , purple-tinged grey , but to the west there was a ruby-red glow
ron stopped dead
oh , please , ron , hermione began
it 's scabbers -- he wo n't -- stay put -- ron was bent over , trying to keep scabbers in his pocket , but the rat was going berserk ; squeaking madly , twisting and flailing , trying to sink his teeth into ron 's hand
scabbers , it 's me , you idiot , it 's ron , ron hissed
they heard a door open behind them and men 's voices
oh , ron , please let 's move , they 're going to do it hermione breathed
okay -- scabbers , stay put -- they walked forward ; harry , like hermione , was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them
ron stopped again
i ca n't hold him -- scabbers , shut up , everyone 'll hear us -- the rat was squealing wildly , but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from hagrid 's garden
there was a jumble of indistinct male voices , a silence , and then , without warning , the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe
hermione swayed on the spot
they did it she whispered to harry
i d -- do n't believe it -- they did itchapter seventeencat , rat , and dogharry 's mind had gone blank with shock
the three of them stood transfixed with horror under the invisibility cloak
the very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long- shadowed grounds
then , behind them , they heard a wild howling
hagrid , harry muttered
without thinking about what he was doing , he made to turn back , but both ron and hermione seized his arms
we ca n't , said ron , who was paper-white
he 'll be in worse trouble if they know we 've been to see him
hermione 's breathing was shallow and uneven
how -- could -- they ? she choked
how could they ? come on , said ron , whose teeth seemed to be chattering
they set off back toward the castle , walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak
the light was fading fast now
by the time they reached open ground , darkness was settling like a spell around them
scabbers , keep still , ron hissed , clamping his hand over his chest
the rat was wriggling madly
ron came to a sudden halt , trying to force scabbers deeper into his pocket
what 's the matter with you , you stupid rat ? stay still -- ouch he bit meron , be quiet hermione whispered urgently
fudge 'll be out here in a minute -- he wo n't -- stay -- put -- scabbers was plainly terrified
he was writhing with all his might , trying to break free of ron 's grip
what 's the matter with him ? but harry had just seen -- stinking toward them , his body low to the ground , wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness -- crookshanks
whether he could see them or was following the sound of scabbers 's squeaks , harry could n't tell
crookshanks hermione moaned
no , go away , crookshanks go awaybut the cat was getting nearer -- scabbers -- notoo late -- the rat had slipped between ron 's clutching fingers , hit the ground , and scampered away
in one bound , crookshanks sprang after him , and before harry or hermione could stop him , ron had thrown the invisibility cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness
ron hermione moaned
she and harry looked at each other , then followed at a sprint ; it as impossible to run full out under the cloak ; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after ron ; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at crookshanks
get away from him -- get away -- scabbers , come here -- there was a loud thud
gotcha get off , you stinking cat -- harry and hermione almost fell over ron ; they skidded to a stop right in front of him
he was sprawled on the ground , but scabbers was back in his pocket ; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump
ron -- come on back under the cloak -- hermione panted
dumbledore the minister -- they 'll be coming back out in a minute -- but before they could cover themselves again , before they could even catch their breath , they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws
something was bounding toward them , quiet as a shadow -- an enormous , pale-eyed , jet-black dog
harry reached for his wand , but too late -- the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest ; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair ; he felt its hot breath , saw inch- long teeth -but the force of its leap had carried it too far ; it rolled off him
dazed , feeling as though his ribs were broken , harry tried to stand up ; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack
ron was on his feet
as the dog sprang back toward them he pushed harry aside ; the dog 's jaws fastened instead around ron 's outstretched arm
harry lunged forward , he seized a handful of the brute 's hair , but it was dragging ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll -- then , out of nowhere , something hit harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again
he heard hermione shriek with pain and fall too
harry groped for his wand , blinking blood out of his eyeslumoshe whispered
the wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree ; they had chased scabbers into the shadow of the whomping willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind , whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer
and there , at the base of the trunk , was the dog , dragging ron backward into a large gap in the roots -- ron was fighting furiously , but his head and torso were slipping out of sight -- ron harry shouted , trying to follow , but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again
all they could see now was one of ron 's legs , which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground -- but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot ; ron 's leg had broken , and a moment later , his foot vanished from sight
harry -- we 've got to go for help -- hermione gasped ; she was bleeding too ; the willow had cut her across the shoulder
no that thing 's big enough to eat him ; we have n't got time -- harry -- we 're never going to get through without help -- another branch whipped down at them , twigs clenched like knuckles
if that dog can get in , we can , harry panted , darting here and there , trying to find a way through the vicious , swishing branches , but he could n't get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree 's blows
oh , help , help , hermione whispered frantically , dancing u
certainly on the spot , please
crookshanks darted forward
he slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk
abruptly , as though the tree had been turned to marble , it stopped moving
not a leaf twitched or shook
crookshanks hermione whispered uncertainly
she now grasped harry 's arm painfully hard
how did he know -- ? he 's friends with that dog , said harry grimly
i 've seen them together
come on -- and keep your wand out -- they covered the distance to the trunk in seconds , but before they had reached the gap in the roots , crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail
harry went next ; he crawled forward , headfirst , and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel
crookshanks was a little way along , his eyes flashing in the light from harry 's wand
seconds later , hermione slithered down beside him
where 's ron ? she whispered in a terrified voice
this way , said harry , setting off , bent-backed , after crookshanks
where does this tunnel come out ? hermione asked breathlessly from behind him
i do n't know
it 's marked on the marauder 's map but fred and george said no one 's ever gotten into it
it goes off the edge of the map , but it looked like it was heading for hogsmeade
they moved as fast as they could , bent almost double ; ahead of them , crookshanks 's tail bobbed in and out of view
on and on went the passage ; it felt at least as long as the one to honeydukes
all harry could think of was ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him
he was drawing breath in sharp , painful gasps , running at a crouch
and then the tunnel began to rise ; moments later it twisted , and crookshanks had gone
instead , harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening
he and hermione paused , gasping for breath , edging forward
both raised their wands to see what lay beyond
it was a room , a very disordered , dusty room
paper was peeling from the walls ; there were stains all over the floor ; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it
the windows were all boarded up
harry glanced at hermione , who looked very frightened but nodded
harry pulled himself out of the hole , staring around
the room was deserted , but a door to their right stood open , leading to a shadowy hallway
hermione suddenly grabbed harry 's arm again
her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows
harry , she whispered , i think we 're in the shrieking shack
harry looked around
his eyes fell on a wooden chair near them
large chunks had been torn out of it ; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely
ghosts did n't do that , he said slowly
at that moment , there was a creak overhead
something had moved upstairs
both of them looked up at the ceiling
hermione 's grip on harry 's arm was so tight he was losing feeling in-his fingers
he raised his eyebrows at her ; she nodded again and let go
quietly as they could , they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase
everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor , where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs
they reached the dark landing
nox , they whispered together , and the lights at the end of their wands went out
only one door was open
as they crept toward it , they heard movement from behind it ; a low moan , and then a deep , loud purring
they exchanged a last look , a last nod
wand held tightly before him , harry kicked the door wide open
on a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay crookshanks , purring loudly at the sight of them
on the floor beside him , clutching his leg , which stuck out at a strange angle , was ron
harry and hermione dashed across to him
ron -- are you okay ? where 's the dog ? not a dog , ron moaned
his teeth were gritted with pain
harry , it 's a trap -- what -- he 's the dog
he 's an animagus
ron was staring over harry 's shoulder
harry wheeled around
with a snap , the man in the shadows closed the door behind them
a mass of filthy , matted hair hung to his elbows
if eyes had n't been shining out of the deep , dark sockets , he might have been a corpse
the waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face , it looked like a skull
his yellow teeth were bared in a grin
it was sirius black
expelliarmushe croaked , pointing ron 's wand at them
harry 's and hermione 's wands shot out of their hands , high in the air , and black caught them
then he took a step closer
his eyes were fixed on harry
i thought you 'd come and help your friend , he said hoarsely
his voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it
your father would have done the same for me
brave of you ) not to run for a teacher
it will make everything much easier
the taunt about his father rang in harry 's ears as though black had bellowed it
a boiling hate erupted in harry 's chest , leaving no place for fear
for the first time in his life , he wanted his wand back in his hand , not to defend himself , but to attack
without knowing what he was doing , he started forward , but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back
no , harry hermione gasped in a petrified whisper ; ron , however , spoke to black
if you want to kill harry , you 'll have to kill us too he said fiercely , though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color , and he swayed slightly as he spoke
something flickered in black 's shadowed eyes
lie down , he said quietly to ron
you will damage that leg even more
did you hear me ? ron said weakly , though he was clinging painfully to harry to stay upright
you 'll have to kill all three of usthere 'll be only one murder here tonight , said brack , and his grin widened
why 's that ? harry spat , trying to wrench himself free of ron , and hermione
did n't care last time , did you ? did n't mind slaughtering all those muggles to get at pettigrew
what 's the matter , gone soft in azkaban ? harry hermione whimpered
be quiethe killed my mum and dad harry roared , and with a huge effort he broke free of hermione 's and ron 's restraint and lunged forward -he had forgotten about magic -- he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen , whereas black was a tall , full-grown man -- all harry knew was that he wanted to hurt black as badly as he could and that he did n't care how much he got hurt in return -- perhaps it was the shock of harry doing something so stupid , but black did n't raise the wands in time -- one of harry 's hands fastened over his wasted wrist , forcing the wand tips away ; the knuckles of harry 's other hand collided with the side of black 's head and they fell , backward , into the wall -hermione was screaming ; ron was yelling ; there was a blinding flash as the wands in black 's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed harry 's face by inches ; harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly , but he clung on , his other hand punching every part of black it could find
but black 's free hand had found harry 's throatno , he hissed , i 've waited too long -- the fingers tightened , harry choked , his glasses askew
then he saw hermione 's foot swing out of nowhere
black let go of harry with a grunt of pain ; ron had thrown himself on black 's wand hand and harry heard a faint clatter -- he fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor ; he threw himself toward it butarghcrookshanks had joined the fray ; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into harry 's arm ; harry threw him off , but crookshanks now darted toward harry 's wand -- no you do n't roared harry , and he aimed a kick at crookshanks that made the cat leap aside , spitting ; harry snatched up his wand and turned -get out of the way he shouted at ron and hermione
they did n't need telling twice
hermione , gasping for breath , her lip bleeding , scrambled aside , snatching up her and ron 's wands
ron crawled to the four-poster and collapsed onto it , panting , his white face now tinged with green , both hands clutching his broken leg
black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall
his thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched harry walking slowly nearer , his wand pointing straight at black 's heart
going to kill me , harry ? he whispered
harry stopped right above him , his wand still pointing at black 's chest , looking down at him
a livid bruise was rising around black 's left eye and his nose was bleeding
you killed my parents , said harry , his voice shaking slightly , but his wand hand quite steady
black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes
i do n't deny it , he said very quietly
but if you knew the whole story
the whole story ? harry repeated , a furious pounding in his ears
you sold them to voldemort
that 's all i need to know
you 've got to listen to me , black said , and there was a note of urgency in his voice now
you 'll regret it if you do n't
you do n't understand
i understand a lot better than you think , said harry , and his voice shook more than ever
you never heard her , did you ? my mum
trying to stop voldemort killing me
and you did that
you did it
before either of them could say another word , something ginger streaked past harry ; crookshanks leapt onto black 's chest and settled himself there , right over black 's heart
black blinked and looked down at the cat
get off , he murmured , trying to push crookshanks off him
but crookshanks sank his claws into black 's robes and would n't shift
he turned his ugly , squashed face to harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes
to his right , hermione gave a dry sob
harry stared down at black and crookshanks , his grip tightening on the wand
so what if he had to kill the cat too ? it was in league with black
if it was prepared to die , trying to protect black , that was n't harry 's business
if black wanted to save it , that only proved he cared more for crookshanks than for harry 's parents
harry raised the wand
now was the moment to do it
now was the moment to avenge his mother and father
he was going to kill black
he had to kill black
this was his chance
the seconds lengthened
and still harry stood frozen there , wand poised , black staring up at him , crookshanks on his chest
ron 's ragged breathing came from near the bed ; hermione was quite silent
and then came a new sound -muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor -- someone was moving downstairs
we 're up here hermione screamed suddenly
we 're up here -- sirius black - quickblack made a startled movement that almost dislodged crookshanks ; harry gripped his wand convulsively -- do it now said a voice in his head -- but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and harry still had n't done it
the door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and harry wheeled around as professor lupin came hurtling into the room , his face bloodless , his wand raised and ready
his eyes flickered over ron , lying on the floor , over hermione , cowering next to the door , to harry , standing there with his wand covering black , and then to black himself , crumpled and bleeding at harry 's feet
expelliarmus lupin shouted
harry 's wand flew once more out of his hand ; so did the two hermione was holding
lupin caught them all deftly , then moved into the room , staring at black , who still had crookshanks lying protectively across his chest
harry stood there , feeling suddenly empty
he had n't done it
his nerve had failed him
black was going to be handed back to the dementors
then lupin spoke , in a very tense voice
where is he , sirius ? harry looked quickly at lupin
he did n't understannd what lupin meant
who was lupin talking about ? he turned to look at black again
black 's face was quite expressionless
for a few seconds , he did n't move at all
then , very slowly , he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at ron
mystified , harry glanced around at ron , who looked bewildered
lupin muttered , staring at black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind ,
why has n't he shown himself before now ? unless -- lupin 's eyes suddenly widened , as though he was seeing something beyond black , something none of the rest could see , -- unless he was the one
unless you switched
without telling me ? very slowly , his sunken gaze never leaving lupin 's face , black nodded
professor , harry interrupted loudly , what 's going on -- ? but he never finished the question , because what he saw made his voice die in his throat
lupin was lowering his wand , gazing fixed at black
the professor walked to black 's side , seized his hand , pulled him to his feet so that crookshanks fell to the floor , and embraced black like a brother
harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach
do n't believe it hermione screamed
lupin let go of black and turned to her
she had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at lupin , wild-eyed
you -- you -- hermione -- -- you and himhermione , calm down -- i did n't tell anyone hermione shrieked
i 've been covering up for you -- hermione , listen to me , please ' lupin shouted
i can explain -- harry could feel himself shaking , not with fear , but with a fresh wave of fury
i trusted you , he shouted at lupin , his voice wavering , out of control , and all the time you 've been his friendyou 're wrong , said lupin
i have n't been sirius 's friend , but i am now -- let me explain
no hermione screamed
harry , do n't trust him , he 's been helping black get into the castle , he wants you dead too -- he 's a werewolfthere was a ringing silence
everyone 's eyes were now on lupin , who looked remarkably calm , though rather pale
not at all up to your usual standard , hermione , he said
only one out of three , i 'm afraid
i have not been helping sirius get into the castle and i certainly do n't want harry dead
an odd shiver passed over his face
but i wo n't deny that i am a werewolf
ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain
lupin made toward him , looking concerned , but ron gasped , get away ftom me , werewolflupin stopped dead
then , with an obvious effort , he turned to hermione and said , how long have you known ? ages , hermione whispered
since i did professor snape 's essay
he 'll be delighted , said lupin coolly
he assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant
did you check the lunar chart and realize that i was always ill at the full moon ? or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me ? both , hermione said quietly
lupin forced a laugh
you 're the cleverest witch of your age i 've ever met , hermione
i 'm not , hermione whispered
if i 'd been a bit cleverer , i 'd have told everyone what you arebut they already know , said lupin
at least , the staff do
dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf
is he mad ? some of the staff thought so , said lupin
he had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that i 'm trustworthy -- and he was wrong harry yelled
youve been helping him all the time he was pointing at black , who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed and sank onto it , his face hidden in one shaking hand
crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap , purring
ron edged away from both of them , dragging his leg
i have not been helping sirius , said lupin
if you 'll give me a chance , i 'll explain
look -- he separated harry 's , ron 's and hermione 's wands and threw each back to its owner ; harry caught his , stunned
there , said lupin , sticking his own wand back into his belt you 're armed , we 're not
now will you listen ? harry did n't know what to think
was it a trick ? if you have n't been helping him , he said , with a furious glance at black , how did you know he was here ? the map , said lupin
the marauder 's map
i was in my office examining it -- you know how to work it ? harry said suspiciously
of course i know how to work it , said lupin , waving his hand impatiently
i helped write it
i 'm moony -- that was my friends ' nickname for me at school
you wrote -- ? the important thing is , i was watching it carefully this evening , because i had an idea that you , ron , and hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit hagrid before his hippogriff was executed
and i was right , was n't ihe had started to pace up and down , looking at them
little patches of dust rose at his feet
you might have been wearing your father 's old cloak , harry -- how d'you know about the cloak ? the number of times i saw james disappearing under it
, said lupin , waving an impatient hand again
the point is , even if you 're wearing an invisibility cloak , you still show up on the marauder 's map
i watched you cross the grounds and enter hagrid 's hut
twenty minutes later , you left hagrid , and set off back toward the castle
but you were now accompanied by somebody else
what ? said harry
no , we weren'ti could n't believe my eyes , said lupin , still pacing , and ignoring harry 's interruption
i thought the map must be malfunctioning
how could he be with you ? no one was with us said harry
and then i saw another dot , moving fast toward you , labeled sirius black
i saw him collide with you ; i watched as he pulled two of you into the whomping willow -- one of us ron said angrily
no , ron , said lupin
two of you
he had stopped his pacing , his eyes moving over ron
do you think i could have a look at the rat ? he said evenly
what ? said ron
what 's scabbers got to do with it ? everything , said lupin
could i see him , please ? ron hesitated , then put a hand inside his robes
scabbers emerged , thrashing desperately ; ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping
crookshanks stood up on black 's leg and made a soft hissing noise
lupin moved closer to ron
he seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at scabbers
what ? ron said again , holding scabbers close to him , looking scared
what 's my rat got to do with anything ? that 's not a rat , croaked sirius black suddenly
what d'you mean -- of course he 's a rat -- no , he 's not , said lupin quietly
he 's a wizard
an animagus , said black , by the name of peter pettigrew
chapter eighteenmoony , wormtail , paddfoot , and prongsit took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in
then ron voiced what harry was thinking
you 're both mental
ridiculous said hermione faintly
peter pettigrew 's dead said harry
he killed him twelve years ago he pointed at black , whose face twitched convulsively
i meant to , he growled , his yellow teeth bared , but little peter got the better of me
not this time , thoughand crookshanks was thrown to the floor as black lunged at scabbers ; ron yelled with pain as black 's weight fell on his broken leg
sirius , no lupin yelled , launching himself forwards and dragging black away from ron again , wait you ca n't do it just like that -- they need to understand -- we 've got to explain -- we can explain afterwards snarled black , trying to throw lupin off
one hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach scabbers , who was squealing like a piglet , scratching ron 's face and neck as he tried to escape
they 've -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything lupin panted , still trying to restrain black
ron 's kept him as a pet there are parts of it even i do n't understand , and harry -- you owe harry the truth , siriusblack stopped struggling , though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on scabbers , who was clamped tightly under ron 's bitten , scratched , ad bleeding hands
all right , then , black said , without taking his eyes off the rat
tell them whatever you like
but make it quick , remus
i want to commit the murder i was imprisoned for
you 're nutters , both of you , said ron shakily , looking round at harry and hermione for support
i 've had enough of this
he tried to heave himself up on his good leg , but lupin raised his wand again , pointing it at scabbers
you 're going to hear me out , ron , he said quietly
just keep a tight hold on peter while you listen
he 's not peter , he 's scabbers ron yelled , trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket , but scabbers was fighting to hard ; ron swayed and overbalanced , and harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed
then , ignoring black , harry turned to lupin
there were witnesses who saw pettigrew die , he said
a whole street full of them
they did n't see what they thought they saw said black savagely , still watching scabbers struggling in ron 's hands
everyone thought sirius killed peter , said lupin , nodding
i believed it myself -- until i saw the map tonight
because the marauder 's map never lies
ron 's holding him , harry
harry looked down at ron , and as their eyes met , they agreed , silently : black and lupin were both out of their minds
their story made no sense whatsoever
how could scabbers be peter pettigrew ? azkaban must have unhinged black after all -- but why was lupin playing along with him ? then hermione spoke , in a trembling , would-be calm sort of voice , as though trying to will professor lupin to talk sensibly
but professor lupin
scabbers ca n't be pettigrew
it just ca n't be true , you know it ca n't
why ca n't it be true ? lupin said calmly , as though they were in class , and hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows
because people would know if peter pettigrew had been an animagus
we did animagi in class with professor mcgonagall
and i looked them up when i did my homework -- the ministry of magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals ; there 's a register showing what animal they become , and their markings and things
and i went and looked professor mcgonagall up on the register , and there have been only seven animagi this century , and pettigrew 's name was n't on the list
harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort hermione put into her homework , when lupin started to laugh
light again , hermione he said
but the ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered animagi running around hogwarts
i you 're going to tell them the story , get a move on , remus , said black , who was still watching scabbers 's every desperate move
i 've waited twelve years , i 'm not going to wait much longer
but you 'll need to help me , sirius , said lupin , i only know how it began
lupin broke off
there had been a loud creak behind him
the bedroom door had opened of its own accord
all five of them stared at it
then lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing
no one there
this place is haunted said ron
it 's not , said lupin , still looking at the door in a puzzled way
the shrieking shack was never haunted
the screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me
he pushed his graying hair out of his eyes , thought for a moment then said , that 's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf , none of this could have happened if i had n't been bitter
and if i had n't been so foolhardy
he looked sober and tired
ron started to interrupt , but hermione , said , shh she was watching lupin very intently
i as a very small boy when i received the bite
my parents tried everything , but in those days there was no cure
the potion that professor snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery
it makes me safe , you see
as long as i take it in the week , preceding the full moon , i keep my mind when i transform
i 'm able to curl up in my office , a harmless wolf , and wait for the moon to wane again
before the wolfsbane potion was discovered , however , i became a fully fledged monster once a month
it seemed impossible that i would be able to come to hogwarts
other parents were n't likely to want their children exposed to me
but then dumbledore became headmaster , and he was sympathetic
he said that as long as we took certain precautions , there was no reason i should n't come to school
lupin sighed , and looked directly at harry
i told you , months ago , that the whomping willow was planted the year i came to hogwarts
the truth is that it was planted because i came to hogwarts
this house -- lupin looked miserably around the room , -- the tunnel that leads to it -- they were built for my use
once a month , i was smuggled out of the castle , into this place , to transform
the tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while i was dangerous
harry could n't see where this story was going , but he was listening raptly all the same
the only sound apart from lupin 's voice was scabbers 's frightened squeaking
my transformations in those days were -- were terrible
it is very painful to turn into a werewolf
i was separated from humans to bite , so i bit and scratched myself instead
the villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits
dumbledore encouraged the rumor
even now , when the house has been silent for years , the villagers do n't dare approach it
but apart from my transformations , i was happier than i had ever been in my life
for the first time ever , i had friends , three great friends
and , of course , your father , harry -- james potter
now , my three friends could hardly fail to notice that i disappeared once a month
i made up all sorts of stories
i told them my mother was ill , and that i had to go home to see her
i was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what i was
but of course , they , like you , hermione , worked out the truth
and they did n't desert me at all
instead , they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable , but the best times of my life
they became animagi
my dad too ? said harry , astounded
yes , indeed , said lupin
it took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it
your father and sirius here were the cleverest students in the school , and lucky they were , because the animagus transformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it
peter needed all the help he could get from james and sirius
finally , in our fifth year , they managed it
they could each turn into a different animal at will
but how did that help you ? said hermione , sounding puzzled
they could n't keep me company as humans , so they kept me company as animals , said lupin
a werewolf is only a danger to people
they sneaked out of the castle every month under james 's invisibility cloak
peter , as the smallest , could slip beneath the willow 's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it
they would then slip down the tunnel and join me
under their influence , i became less dangerous
my body was still wolfish , but my mind seemed to become less so while i was with them
hurry up , remus , snarled black , who was still watching scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face
i 'm getting there , sirius , i 'm getting there
well , highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform
soon we were leaving the shrieking shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night
sirius and james transformed into such large animals , they were able to keep a werewolf in check
i doubt whether any hogwarts students ever found out more about the hogwarts grounds and hogsmeade than we did
and that 's how we came to write the marauder 's map , and sign it with our nicknames
sirius is padfoot
peter is wormtail
james was prongs
what sort of animal -- ? harry began , but hermione cut him off
that was still really dangerous running around in the dark with a werewolf what if you 'd given the others the slip , and bitten somebody ? a thought that still haunts me , said lupin heavily
and there were near misses , many of them
we laughed about them afterwards
we were young , thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness
i sometimes felt guilty about betraying dumbledore 's trust , of course
he had admitted me to hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so , and he had no idea i was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others ' safety
he never knew i had led three fellow students into becoming animagi illegally
but i always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month 's adventure
and i have n't changed
lupin 's face had hardened , and there was self-disgust in his voice
all this year , i have been battling with myself , wondering whether i should tell dumbledore that sirius was an animagus
but i did n't do it
why ? because i was too cowardly
it would have meant admitting that i 'd betrayed his trust while i was at school , admitting that i 'd led others along with me
and dumbledore 's trust has meant everything to me
he let me into hogwarts as a boy , and he gave me a job when i have been shunned all my adult life , unable to find paid work because of what i am
and so i convinced myself that sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from voldemort , that being an animagus had nothing to do with it
so , in a way , snape 's been right about me all along
snape ? said black harshly , taking his eyes off scabbers ; for the first time in minutes and looking up at lupin
what 's snape got to do with it ? he 's here , sirius , said lupin heavily
he 's teaching here as well
he looked up at harry , ron , and hermione
professor snape was at school with us
he fought very hard against my appointment to the defense against the dark arts job
he has been telling dumbledore a year that i am not to be trusted
he has his reasons
you see , sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him , a trick which involved me -- black made a derisive noise
it served him right , he sneered
sneaking around , trying to find out what we were up to
hoping he could get us expelled
severus was very interested in where i went every month
lupin told harry , ron , and hermione
we were in the same year , you know , and we -- er -- did n't like each other very much
he especially disliked james
jealous , i think , of james 's talent on the quidditch field
anyway snape had seen me crossing the grounds with madam pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the whomping willow to transform
sirius thought it would be -- er -- amusing , to tell snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick , and he 'd be able to get in after me
well , of course , snape tried it -- if he 'd got as far as this house , he 'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father , who 'd heard what sirius had done , went after snape and pulled him back , at great risk to his life
snape glimpsed me , though , at the end of the tunnel
he was forbidden by dumbledore to tell anybody , but from that time on he knew what i was
so that 's why snape does n't like you , said harry slowly , because he thought you were in on the joke ? that 's right , sneered a cold voice from the wall behind lupin
severus snape was pulling off the invisibility cloak , his wand pointing , directly at lupin
chapter nineteenthe servant of lord voldemorthermione screamed
black leapt to his feet
harry felt as though he 'd received a huge electric shock
i found this at the base of the whomping willow , said snape , throwing the cloak aside , careful to keep this wand pointing directly at lupin 's chest
very useful , potter , i thank you
snape was slightly breathless , but his face was full of suppressed triumph
you 're wondering , perhaps , how i knew you were here ? he said , his eyes glittering
i 've just been to your office , lupin
you forgot to take your potion tonight , so i took a gobletful along
and very lucky i did
lucky for me , i mean
lying on your desk was a certain map
one glance at it told me all i needed to know
i saw you running along this passageway and out of sight
severus -- lupin began , but snape overrode him
i 've told the headmaster again and again that you 're helping your old friend black into the castle , lupin , and here 's the proof
not even i dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout -- severus , you 're making a mistake , said lupin urgently
you have n't heard everything -- i can explain -- sirius is not here to kill harry -- two more for azkaban tonight , said snape , his eyes now gleaming fanatically
i shall be interested to see how dumbledore takes this
he was quite convinced you were harmless , you know , lupin
a tame werewolf -- you fool , said lupin softly
is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside azkaban ? bang thin , snakelike cords burst from the end of snape 's wand and twisted themselves around lupin 's mouth , wrists , and ankles ; he overbalanced and fell to the floor , unable to move
with a roar of rage , black started toward snape , but snape pointed his wand straight between black 's eyes
give me a reason , he whispered
give me a reason to do it , and i swear i will
black stopped dead
it would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred
harry stood there , paralyzed , not knowing what to do or whom to believe
he glanced around at ron and hermione
ron looked just as confused as he did , still fighting to keep hold on the struggling scabbers
hermione , however , took an uncertain step toward snape and said , in a very breathless voice , professor snape -- it it would n't hurt to hear what they 've got to say , w -- would it ? miss granger , you are already facing suspension from this school , snape spat
you , potter , and weasley are out-of-bounds , in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf
for once in your life , hold your tongue
but if -- if there was a mistake -- keep quiet , you stupid girl snape shouted , looking suddenly quite deranged
do n't talk about what you do n't understand a few sparks shot out of the end of his wand , which was still pointed at black 's face
hermione fell silent
vengeance is very sweet , snape breathed at black
how i hoped i would be the one to catch you
the joke 's on you again , severus , black snarled
as long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle -- he jerked his head at ron -- i 'll come quietly
up to the castle ? said snape silkily
i do n't think we need to go that far
all i have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the willow
they 'll be very pleased to see you , black
pleased enough to give you a little kiss , i daresay
i -- what little color there was in blacks face left it
you -you 've got to hear me out , he croaked
the rat -- look at the rat -- but there was a mad glint in snape 's eyes that harry had never seen before
he seemed beyond reason
come on , all of you , he said
he clicked his fingers , and the ends of the cords that bound lupin flew to his hands
i 'll drag the werewolf
perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too -- before he knew what he was doing , harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door
get out of the way , potter , you 're in enough trouble already , snarled snape
if i had n't been here to save your skin -- professor lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year , harry said
i 've been alone with him loads of times , having defense lessons against the dementors
if he was helping black , why did n't he just finish me off then ? do n't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf 's mind works , hissed snape
get out of the way , potter
youre pathetic harry yelled
just because they made a fool of you at school you wo n't even listen -- silence i will not be spoken to like that snape shrieked , looking madder than ever
like father , like son , potter i have just saved your neck ; you should be thanking me on bended knee you would have been well served if he 'd killed you you 'd have died like your father , too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in black -- now get out of the way , or i will make you
get out of the way , potterharry made up his mind in a split second
before snape could take even one step toward him , he had raised his wand
expelliarmus he yelled -- except that his was n't the only voice that shouted
there was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges ; snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall , then slid down it to the floor , a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair
he had been knocked out
harry looked around
both ron and hermione had tried to disarm snape at exactly the same moment
snape 's wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to crookshanks
you should n't have done that , said black , looking at harry
you should have left him to me
harry avoided black 's eyes
he was n't sure , even now , that he 'd done the right thing
we attacked a teacher
we attacked a teacher
hermione whimpered , staring at the lifeless snape with frightened eyes
oh , we 're going to be in so much trouble -- lupin was struggling against his bonds
black bent down quickly and untied him
lupin straightened up , rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them
thank you , harry , he said
i 'm still not saying i believe you , he told lupin
then it 's time we offered you some proof , said lupin
you , boy -- give me peter , please
ron clutched scabbers closer to his chest
come off it , he said weakly
are you trying to say he broke out of azkaban just to get his hands on scabbers ? i mean
he looked up at harry and hermione for support , okay , say pettigrew could turn into a rat -- there are millions of rats -- how 's he supposed to know which one he 's after if he was locked up in azkaban ? you know , sirius , that 's a fair question , said lupin , turning to black and frowning slightly
how did you find out where he was ? black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper , which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others
it was the photograph of ron and his family that had appeared in the daily prophet the previous summer , and there , on ron 's shoulder , was scabbers
how did you get this ? lupin asked black , thunderstruck
fudge , said black
when he came to inspect azkaban last year , he gave me his paper
and there was peter , on the front page on this boy 's shoulder
i knew him at once
how many times had i seen him transform ? and the caption said the boy would be going back to hogwarts
to where harry was
my god , said lupin softly , staring from scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again
his front paw
what about it ? said ron defiantly
he 's got a toe missing , said black
of course , lupin breathed
he cut it off himself ? just before he transformed , said black
when i cornered him , he yelled for the whole street to hear that i 'd betrayed lily and james
then , before i could curse him , he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back , killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and sped down into the sewer with the other rats
did n't you ever hear , ron ? said lupin
the biggest bit of peter they found was his finger
look , scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something he 's been in my family for ages , right -- twelve years , in fact , said lupin
did n't you ever wonder why he was living so long ? we -- we 've been taking good care of him said ron
not looking too good at the moment , though , is he ? said lupin
i 'd guess he 's been losing weight ever since he heard sirius was on the loose again
he 's been scared of that mad cat said ron , nodding toward crookshanks , who was still purring on the bed
but that was n't right , harry thought suddenly
scabbers had been looking ill before he met crookshanks
ever since ron 's return from egypt
since the time when black had escaped
this cat is n't mad , said black hoarsely
he reached out a bony hand and stroked crookshanks 's fluffy head
he 's the most intelligent of his kind i 've ever met
he recognized peter for what he was right away
and when he met me , he knew i was no dog
it was a while before he trusted me
finally , i managed to communicate to him what i was after , and he 's been helping me
what do you mean ? breathed hermione
he tried to bring peter to me , but could n't
so he stole the passwords into gryffindor tower for me
as i understand it , he took them from a boy 's bedside table
harry 's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing
it was absurd
but peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it
this cat -- crookshanks , did you call him ? -- told me peter had left blood on the sheets
i supposed he bit himself
well , faking his own death had worked once
these words jolted harry to his senses
and why did he fake his death ? he said furiously
because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parentsno , said lupin , harry-and now you 've come to finish him offyes , i have , said black , with an evil look at scabbers
then i should 've let snape take you harry shouted
harry , said lupin hurriedly , do n't you see ? all this time we 've thought sirius betrayed your parents , and peter tracked him down -- but it was the other way around , do n't you see ? peter betrayed your mother and father -- sirius tracked peter down -- that 's not true harry yelled
he was their secret-keeper he said so before you turned up
he said he killed themhe was pointing at black , who shook his head slowly ; the sunken eyes were suddenly over bright
i as good as killed them , he croaked
i persuaded lily and james to change to peter at the last moment , persuaded them to use him as secret-keeper instead of me
i 'm to blame , i know it
the night they died , i 'd arranged to check on peter , make sure he was still safe , but when i arrived at his hiding place , he 'd gone
yet there was no sign of a struggle
it did n't feel right
i was scared
i set out for your parents ' house straight away
and when i saw their house , destroyed , and their bodies
i realized what peter must 've done
what i 'd done
his voice broke
he turned away
enough of this , said lupin , and there was a steely note in his voice harry had never heard before
there 's one certain way to prove what really happened
ron , give me that rat
what are you going to do with him if i give him to you ? ron asked lupin tensely
force him to show himself , said lupin
if he really is a rat , it wo n't hurt him
then at long last , he held out scabbers and lupin took him
scabbers began to squeak without stopping , twisting and turning , his tiny black eyes bulging in his head
ready , sirius ? said lupin
black had already retrieved snape 's wand from the bed
he approached lupin and the struggling rat , and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face
together ? he said quietly
i think so , , , said lupin , holding scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other
on the count of three
one -- two -- threea flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands ; for a moment , scabbers was frozen in midair , his small gray form twisting madly -- ron yelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor
there was another blinding flash of light and then -- it was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree
a head was shooting upward from the ground ; limbs were sprouting ; a moment later , a man was standing where scabbers had been , cringing and wringing his hands
crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed ; the hair on his back was standing up
he was a very short man , hardly taller than harry and hermione
his thin , colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top
he had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time
his skin looked grubby , almost like scabbers 's fur , and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small , watery eyes
he looked around at them all , his breathing fast and shallow
harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again
well , hello , peter , said lupin pleasantly , as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him
long time , no see
s -- sirius
r -- remus
even pettigrew 's voice was squeaky
again , his eyes darted toward the door
my old friends
black 's wand arm rose , but lupin seized him around the wrist , gave him a warning took , then turned again to pettigrew , his voice light and casual
we 've been having a little chat , peter , about what happened the night lily and james died
you might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed -- remus , gasped pettigrew , and harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face , you do n't believe him , do you
? he tried to kill me , remus
so we 've heard , said lupin , more coldly
i 'd like to clear up one or two little matters with you , peter , if you 'll be so -- he 's come to try and kill me again pettigrew squeaked suddenly , pointing at black , and harry saw that he used his middle finger , because his index was missing
he killed lily and james and now he 's going to kill me too
you 've got to help me , remus
black 's face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at pettigrew with his fathomless eyes
no one 's going to try and kill you until we 've sorted a few things out , said lupin
sorted things out ? squealed pettigrew , looking wildly about him once more , eyes taking in the boarded windows and , again ' the only door
i knew he 'd come after me i knew he 'd be back for me i 've been waiting for this for twelve yearsyou knew sirius was going to break out of azkaban ? said lupin , his brow furrowed
when nobody has ever done it before ? he 's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of pettigrew shouted shrilly
how else did he get out of there ? i suppose he-who-must-not-be-named taught him a few tricksblack started to laugh , a horrible , mirthless laugh that filled the whole room
voldemort , teach me tricks ? he said
pettigrew flinched as though black had brandished a whip at him
what , scared to hear your old master 's name ? said black
i do n't blame you , peter
his lot are n't very happy with you , are they ? do n't know what you mean , sirius -- muttered pettigrew , his breathing faster than ever
his whole face was shining with sweat now
you have n't been hiding from me for twelve years , said black
you 've been hiding from voldemort 's old supporters
i heard things in azkaban , peter
they all think you 're dead , or you 'd have to answer to them
i 've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep
sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them
voldemort went to the potters ' on your information
and voldemort met his downfall there
and not all voldemort 's supporters ended up in azkaban , did they ? there are still plenty out here , biding their time , pretending they 've seen the error of their ways
if they ever got wind that you were still alive , peter -- do n't know
what you 're talking about
, said pettigrew again , more shrilly than ever
he wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at lupin
you do n't believe this -- this madness , remus -- i must admit , peter , i have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat , said lupin evenly
innocent , but scared squealed pettigrew
if voldemort 's supporters were after me , it was because i put one of their best men in azkaban -- the spy , sirius blackblack 's face contorted
how dare you , he growled , sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been
i , a spy for voldemort ? when did i ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself ? but you , peter -- i 'll never understand why i did n't see you were the spy from the start
you always liked big friends who 'd look after you , did n't you ? it used to be us
me and remus
pettigrew wiped his face again ; he was almost panting for breath
me , a spy
must be out of your mind
do n't know how you can say such a -- lily and james only made you secret-keeper because i suggested it , black hissed , so venomously that pettigrew took a step backward
i thought it was the perfect plan
voldemort would be sure to come after me , would never dream they 'd use a weak , talentless thing like you
it must have been the finest moment of your miserable life , telling voldemort you could hand him the potters
pettigrew was muttering distractedly ; harry caught words like far-fetched and lunacy , but he could n't help paying more attention to the ashen color of pettigrew 's face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door
professor lupin ? said hermione timidly
can -- can i say something ? certainly , hermione , said lupin courteously
well -- scabbers -- i mean , this -- this man -- he 's been sleeping in harry 's dormitory for three years
if he 's working for you-know-who , how come he never tried to hurt harry before now ? there said pettigrew shrilly , pointing at ron with his maimed hand
thank you you see , remus ? i have never hurt a hair of harry 's head why should i ? i 'll tell you why , said black
because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you
voldemort 's been in hiding for fifteen years , they say he 's half dead
you were n't about to commit murder right under albus dumbledore 's nose , for a wreck of a wizard who 'd lost all of his power , were you ? you 'd want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him , would n't you ? why else did you find a wizard family to take you in ? keeping an ear out for news , were n't you , peter ? just in case your old protector regained strength , and it was safe to rejoin him
pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times
he seemed to have lost the ability to talk
er -- mr
black -- sirius ? said hermione
black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her
if you do n't mind me asking , how -- how did you get out of azkaban , if you did n't use dark magic ? thank you gasped pettigrew , nodding frantically at her
exactly precisely what i -- but lupin silenced him with a look
black was frowning slightly at hermione , but not as though he were annoyed with her
he seemed to be pondering his answer
i do n't know how i did it , he said slowly
i think the only reason i never lost my mind is that i knew i was innocent
that was n't a happy thought , so the dementors could n't suck it out of me
but it kept me sane and knowing who i am
helped me keep my powers
so when it all became
i could transform in my cell
become a dog
dementors ca n't see , you know
they feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions
they could tell that my feelings were less -- less human , less complex when i was a dog
but they thought , of course , that i was losing my mind like everyone else in there , so it did n't trouble them
but i was weak , very weak , and i had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand
but then i saw peter in that picture
i realized he was at hogwarts with harry
perfectly positioned to act , if one hint reached his ears that the dark side was gathering strength again
pettigrew was shaking his head , mouthing noiselessly , but staring all the while at black as though hypnotized
ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies
and to deliver the last potter to them
if he gave them harry , who 'd dare say he 'd betrayed lord voldemort ? he 'd be welcomed back with honors
so you see , i had to do something
i was the only one who knew peter was still alive
harry remembered what mr
weasley had told mrs
the guards say he 's been talking in his sleep
always the same words
he 's at hogwarts
it was as if someone had lit a fire in my head , and the dementors could n't destroy it
it was n't a happy feeling
it was an obsession
but it gave me strength , it cleared my mind
so , one night when they opened my door to bring food , i slipped past them as a dog
it 's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused
i was thin , very thin
thin enough to slip through the bars
i swam as a dog back to the mainland
i journeyed north and slipped into the hogwarts grounds as a dog
i 've been living in the forest ever since , except when i came to watch the quidditch , of course
you fly as well as your father did , harry
he looked at harry , who did not look away
believe me , croaked black
believe me , harry
i never betrayed james and lily
i would have died before i betrayed them
and at long last , harry believed him
throat too tight to speak , he nodded
nopettigrew had fallen to his knees as though harry 's nod had been his own death sentence
he shuffled forward on his knees , groveling , his hands clasped in front of him as though praying
sirius -- it 's me
you would n't -- black kicked out and pettigrew recoiled
there 's enough filth on my robes without you touching them , said black
remus pettigrew squeaked , turning to lupin instead , writhing imploringly in front of him
you do n't believe this would n't sirius have told you they 'd changed the plan ? not if he thought i was the spy , peter , said lupin
i assume that 's why you did n't tell me , sirius ? he said casually over pettigrews head
forgive me , remus , said black
not at all , padfoot , old friend , said lupin , who was now rolling up his sleeves
and will you , in turn , forgive me for believing you were the spy ? of course , said black , and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face
he , too , began rolling up his sleeves
shall we kill him together ? yes , i think so , said lupin grimly
, gasped pettigrew
and he scrambled around to ron
have n't i been a good friend
a good pet ? you wo n't let them kill me , ron , will you
you 're on my side , are n't you
but ron was staring at pettigrew with the utmost revulsion
i let you sleep in my bed he said
pettigrew crawled toward ron you wo n't let them do it
i was your rat
i was a good pet
if you made a better rat than a human , it 's not much to boast about , peter , said black harshly
ron , going still paler with pain , wrenched his broken leg out of pettigrew 's reach
pettigrew turned on his knees , staggered forward , and seized the hem of hermione 's robes
you -- you wo n't let them
hermione pulled her robes out of pettigrew 's clutching hands and backed away against the wall , looking horrified
pettigrew knelt , trembling uncontrollably , and-turned his head slowly toward harry
you look just like your father
just like him
how dare you speak to harry ? roared black
how dare you face him ? how dare you talk about james in front of him ? harry , whispered pettigrew , shuffling toward him , hands outstretched
harry , james would n't have wanted me killed
james would have understood , harry
he would have shown me mercy
both black and lupin strode forward , seized pettigrew 's shoulders , and threw him backward onto the floor
he sat there , twitching with terror , staring up at them
you sold lily and james to voldemort , said black , who was shaking too
do you deny it ? pettigrew burst into tears
it was horrible to watch , like an oversized , balding baby , cowering on the floor
sirius , sirius , what could i have done ? the dark lord
you have no idea
he has weapons you ca n't imagine
i was scared , sirius , i was never brave like you and remus and james
i never meant it to happen
he-who-must-not-be-named forced me -- do n't lie bellowed black
you 'd been passing information to him for a year before lily and james died you were his spyhe -- he was taking over everywhere gasped pettigrew
wh -- what was there to be gained by refusing him ? what was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed ? said black , with a terrible fury in his face
only innocent lives , peteryou do n't understand whined pettigrew
he would have killed me , siriusthen you should have died roared black
died rather than betray your friends , as we would have done for youblack and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder , wands raised
you should have realized , said lupin quietly , if voldemort did n't kill you , we would
hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall
no harry yelled
he ran forward , placing himself in front pettigrew , facing the wands
you ca n't kill him , he said breathlessly
black and lupin both looked staggered
harry , this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents , black snarled
this cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too , without turning a hair
you heard him
his own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family
i know , harry panted
we 'll take him up to the castle
we 'll hand him over to the dementors
he can go to azkaban
but do n't kill him
harry gasped pettigrew , and he flung his arms around harry 's knees
you -- thank you -- it 's more than i deserve -- thank you -- get off me , harry spat , throwing pettigrew 's hands off him in disgust
i 'm not doing this for you
i 'm doing it because -- i do n't reckon my dad would 've wanted them to become killers -- just for you
no one moved or made a sound except pettigrew , whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest
black and lupin were looking at each other
then , with one movement , they lowered their wands
you 're the only person who has the right to decide , harry , said black
think what he did
he can go to azkaban , harry repeated
if anyone deserves that place , he does
pettigrew was still wheezing behind him
very well , said lupin
stand aside , harry
i 'm going to tie him up , said lupin
that 's all , i swear
harry stepped out of the way
thin cords shot from lupin 's wand this time , and next moment , pettigrew was wriggling on the floor , bound and gagged
but if you transform , peter , growled black , his own wand pointing at pettigrew too , we will kill you
you agree , harry ? harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that pettigrew could see him
right , said lupin , suddenly businesslike
ron , i ca n't mend bones nearly as well as madam pomfrey , so i think it 's best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing
he hurried over to ron , bent down , tapped ron 's leg with his wand , and muttered , ferula
bandages spun up ron 's leg , strapping it tightly to a splint
lupin helped him to his feet ; ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and did n't wince
that 's better , he said
what about professor snape ? said hermione in a small voice , looking down at snape 's prone figure
there 's nothing seriously wrong with him , said lupin , bending over snape and checking his pulse
you were just a little -- overenthusiastic
still out cold
er -- perhaps it will be best if we do n't revive him until we 're safety back in the castle
we can take him like this
he muttered , mobilicorpus
as though invisible strings were tied to snape 's wrists , neck , and knees , he was pulled into a standing position , head still lolling unpleasantly , like a grotesque puppet
he hung a few inches above the ground , his limp feet dangling
lupin picked up the invisibility cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket
and two of us should be chained to this , said black , nudging pettigrew with his toe
just to make sure
i 'll do it , said lupin
and me , said ron savagely , limping forward
black conjured heavy manacles from thin air ; soon pettigrew was upright again , left arm chained to lupin 's right , right arm to ron 's left
ron 's face was set
he seemed to have taken scabbers 's true identity as a personal insult
crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room , his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high
chapter twentythe dementor 's kissharry had never been part of a stranger group
crookshanks led the way down the stairs ; lupin , pettigrew , and ron went next , looking like entrants in a six-legged race
next came professor snape , drifting creepily along , his toes hitting each stair as they descended , held up by his own wand , which was being pointed at him by sirius
harry and hermione brought up the rear
getting back into the tunnel was difficult
lupin , pettigrew , and ron had to turn sideways to manage it ; lupin still had pettigrew covered with his wand
harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file
crookshanks was still in the lead
harry went right after black , who was still making snape drift along ahead of them ; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling
harry had the impression black was making no effort to prevent this
you know what this means ? black said abruptly to harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel
turning pettigrew in ? you ' re free , said harry
, said black
but i 'm also -- i do n't know if anyone ever told you -- i 'm your godfather
yeah , i knew that , said harry
your parents appointed me your guardian , said black stiffly
if anything happened to them
did black mean what he thought he meant ? i 'll understand , of course , if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle , said black
think about it
once my name 's cleared
if you wanted a
a different home
some sort of explosion took place in the pit of harry 's stomach
what -- live with you ? he said , accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling
leave the dursleys ? of course , i thought you would n't want to , said black quickly
i understand , i just thought i 'd -- are you insane ? said harry , his voice easily as croaky as black 's
of course i want to leave the dursleys have you got a house ? when can i move in ? black turned right around to look at him ; snape 's head was scraping the ceiling but black did n't seem to care
you want to ? he said
you mean it ? yeah , i mean it said harry
black 's gaunt face broke into the first true smile harry had seen upon it
the difference it made was startling , as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask ; for a moment , he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at harry 's parents ' wedding
they did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel
crookshanks darted up first ; he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk , because lupin , pettigrew , and ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches
black saw snape up through the hole , then stood back for harry and hermione to pass
at last , all of them were out
the grounds were very dark now ; the only light came from the distant windows of the castle
without a word , they set off
pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering
harry 's mind was buzzing
he was going to leave the dursleys
he was going to live with sirius black , his parents ' best friend
he felt dazed
what would happen when he told the dursleys he was going to live with the convict they 'd seen on television
one wrong move , peter , said lupin threateningly ahead
his wand was still pointed sideways at pettigrew 's chest
silently they tramped through the grounds , the castle lights growing slowly larger
snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of black , his chin bumping on his chest
and then -a cloud shifted
there were suddenly dim shadows on the ground
their party was bathed in moonlight
snape collided with lupin , pettigrew , and ron , who had stopped abruptly
he flung out one arm to make harry and hermione stop
harry could see lupin 's silhouette
he had gone rigid
then his limbs began to shake
oh , my -- hermione gasped
he did n't take his potion tonight he 's not saferun , black whispered
but harry could n't run
ron was chained to pettigrew and lupin
he leapt forward but black caught him around the chest and threw him back
leave it to me -- runthere was a terrible snarling noise
lupin 's head was lengthening
so was his body
his shoulders were hunching
hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands , which were curling into clawed paws
crookshanks 's hair was on end again ; he was backing away -- as the werewolf reared , snapping its long jaws , sirius disappeared from harry 's side
he had transformed
the enormous , bearlike dog bounded forward
as the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it , the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward , away from ron and pettigrew
they were locked , jaw to jaw , claws ripping at each other
harry stood , transfixed by the sight , too intent upon the battle to notice anything else
it was hermione 's scream that alerted him -- pettigrew had dived for lupin 's dropped wand
ron , unsteady on his bandaged leg , fell
there was a bang , a burst of light -- and ron lay motionless on the ground
another bang -- crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap
harry yelled , pointing his own wand at pettigrew ; lupin 's wand flew high into the air and out of sight
stay where you are harry shouted , running forward
pettigrew had transformed
harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on ron 's outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass
there was a howl and a rumbling growl ; harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight ; it was galloping into the forest -- sirius , he 's gone , pettigrew transformed harry yelled
black was bleeding ; there were gashes across his muzzle and back , but at harry 's words he scrambled up again , and in an instant , the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds
harry and hermione dashed over to ron
what did he do to him ? hermione whispered
ron 's eyes were only half-closed , his mouth hung open ; he was definitely alive , they could hear him breathing , but he did n't seem to recognize them
i do n't know
harry looked desperately around
black and lupin both gone
they had no one but snape for company , still hanging , unconscious , in midair
we 'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone , said harry , pushing his hair out of his eyes , trying to think straight
come -- but then , from beyond the range of their vision , they heard a yelping , a whining : a dog in pain
sirius , harry muttered , staring into the darkness
he had a moment 's indecision , but there was nothing they could do for ron at the moment , and by the sound of it , black was in trouble -- harry set off at a run , hermione right behind him
the yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake
they pelted toward it , and harry , running flat out , felt the cold without realizing what it must mean -the yelping stopped abruptly
as they reached the lakeshore , they saw why -- sirius had turned back into a man
he was crouched on all fours , his hands over his head
'nooo , he moaned
and then harry saw them
dementors , at least a hundred of them , gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them
he spun around , the familiar , icy cold penetrating his insides , fog starting to obscure his vision ; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side ; they were encircling them
herrnione , think of something happy harry yelled , raising his wand , blinking furiously to try and clear his vision , shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it -- i 'm going to live with my godfather
i 'm leaving the dursleys
he forced himself to think of black , and only black , and began to chant : expecto patronum expecto patronumblack gave a shudder , rolled over , and lay motionless on the ground , pale as death
he 'll be all right
i 'm going to go and live with him
expecto patronum hermione , help me expecto patronumexpecto -- hermione whispered , expecto -- expecto -- but she could n't do it
the dementors were closing in , barely ten feet from them
they formed a solid wall around harry and hermione , and were getting closer
expecto patronum harry yelled , trying to blot the screaming from his ears
expecto patronuma thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him
at the same moment , harry felt hermione collapse next to him
he was alone
expecto -- expecto patronum -- harry felt his knees hit the cold grass
fog was clouding his eyes
with a huge effort , he fought to remember -- sirius was innocent -- innocent -- we 'll be okay -- i ' mgoing to live with him -- ex ecto patronum he gasped
by the feeble light of his formless patronus , he saw a dementor halt , very close to him
it could n't walk through the cloud of silver mist harry had conjured
a dead , slimy hand slid out from under the cloak
it made a gesture as though to sweep the patronus aside
no -- no -- harry gasped
expecto expecto patronum -- he could feet them watching him , hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him
the nearest dementor seemed to be considering him
then it raised both its rotting hands -- and lowered its hood
where there should have been eyes , there was only thin , gray scabbed skin , stretched blankly over empty sockets
but there was a mouth
a gaping , shapeless hole , sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle
a paralyzing terror filled harry so that he could n't move or speak
his patronus flickered and died
white fog was blinding him
he had to fight
he could n't see
and in the distance , he heard the familiar screaming
he groped in the mist for sirius , and found his arm
they were n't going to take him
but a pair of strong , clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around harry 's neck
they were forcing his face upward
he could feel its breath
it was going to get rid of him first
he could feel its putrid breath
his mother was screaming in his ears
she was going to be the last thing he ever heard -- and then , through the fog that was drowning him , he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter
he felt himself fall forward onto the grass
facedown , too weak to move , sick and shaking , harry opened his eyes
the dementor must have released him
the blinding light was illuminating the grass around him
the screaming had stopped , the cold was ebbing away
something was driving the dementors back
it was circling around him and black and hermione
they were leaving
the air was warm again
with every ounce of strength he could muster , harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light , galloping away across the lake
eyes blurred with sweat , harry tried to make out what it was
it was as bright as a unicorn
fighting to stay conscious , harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore
for a moment , harry saw , by its brightness , somebody welcoming it back
raising his hand to pat it
someone who looked strangely familiar
but it could n't be
harry did n't understand
he could n't think anymore
he felt the last of his strength leave him , and his head hit the ground as he fainted
chapter twenty-onehermione 's secretshocking business
miracle none of them died
never heard the like
by thunder , it was lucky you were there , snape
thank you , minister
order of merlin , second class , i 'd say
first class , if i can wangle itthank you very much indeed , minister
nasty cut you 've got there
black 's work , i suppose ? as a matter of fact , it was potter , weasley , and granger , minister
noblack had bewitched them , i saw it immediately
a confundus charm , to judge by their behavior
they seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent
they were n't responsible for their actions
on the other hand , their interference might have permitted black to escape
they obviously thought they were going to catch black single-handed
they 've got away with a great deal before now
i 'm afraid it 's given them a rather high opinion of themselves
and of course potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster -- ah , well , snape
harry potter , you know
we 've all got a bit of a blind spot where he 's concerned
and yet -- is it good for him to be given so much special treatment ? personally , i try and treat him like any other student
and any other student would be suspended -- at the very least -- for leading his friends into such danger
consider , minister -- against all school rules -- after all the precautions put in place for his protection -- out-of-bounds , at night , consorting with a werewolf and a murderer -- and i have reason to believe he has been visiting hogsmeade illegally too -- well , well
we shall see , snape , we shall see
the boy has undoubtedly been foolish
harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut
he felt very groggy
the words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain , so that it was difficult to understand
his limbs felt like lead ; his eyelids too heavy to lift
he wanted to lie here , on this comfortable bed , forever
what amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors
you 've really no idea what made them retreat , snape ? no , minister
by the time i had come 'round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances
and yet black , and harry , and the girl -- all unconscious by the time i reached them
i bound and gagged black , naturally , conjured stretchers , and brought them all straight back to the castle
there was a pause
harry 's brain seemed to be moving a little faster , and as it did , a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach
he opened his eyes
everything was slightly blurred
somebody had removed his glasses
he was lying in the dark hospital wing
at the very end of the ward , he could make out madam pomfrey with her back to him , bending over a bed
ron 's red hair was visible beneath madam pomfrey 's arm
harry moved his head over on the pillow
in the bed to his right lay hermione
moonlight was falling across her bed
her eyes were open too
she looked petrified , and when she saw that harry was awake , pressed a finger to her lips , then pointed to the hospital wing door
it was ajar , and the voices of cornelius fudge and snape were coming through it from the corridor outside
madam pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to harry 's bed
he turned to took at her
she was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life
it looked like a small boulder
ah , you 're awake she said briskly
she placed the chocolate on harry 's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer
how 's ron ? said harry and hermione together
he 'll live , said madam pomfrey grimly
as for you two you 'll be staying here until i 'm satisfied you 're -- potter , what do you think you 're doing ? harry was sitting up , putting his glasses back on , and picking up his wand
i need to see the headmaster , he said
potter , said madam pomfrey soothingly , it 's all right
they 've got black
he 's locked away upstairs
the dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now -- what ? harry jumped up out of bed ; hermione had done the same
but his shout had been heard in the corridor outside ; next second , cornelius fudge and snape had entered the ward
harry , harry , what 's this ? said fudge , looking agitated
you should be in bed -- has he had any chocolate ? he asked madam pomfrey anxiously
minister , listen harry said
sirius black 's innocent peter pettigrew faked his own death we saw him tonight you ca n't let the dementors do that thing to sirius , he 's -- but fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face
harry , harry , you 're very confused , you 've been through a dreadful ordeal , lie back down , now , we 've got everything under control
you have n't harry yelled
youve got the wrong manminister , listen , please , hermione said ; she had hurried to harry 's side and was gazing imploringly into fudge 's face
i saw him too
it was ron 's rat , he 's an animagus , pettigrew , i mean , and -- you see , minister ? said snape
confunded , both of them
black 's done a very good job on them
we 're not confunded harry roared
minister professor said madam pomfrey angrily
i must insist that you leave
potter is my patient , and he should not be distressedi 'm not distressed , i 'm trying to tell them what happened harry said furiously
if they 'd just listen -- but madam pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into harry 's mouth ; he choked , and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed
now , please , minister , these children need care
please leavethe door opened again
it was dumbledore
harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again
professor dumbledore , sirius black -- for heaven 's sake said madam pomfrey hysterically
is this a hospital wing or not ? headmaster , i must insist -- my apologies , poppy , but i need a word with mr
potter and miss granger , said dumbledore calmly
i have just been talking to sirius black -- i suppose he 's told you the same fairy tale he 's planted in potter 's mind ? spat snape
something about a rat , and pettigrew being alive -- that , indeed , is black 's story , said dumbledore , surveying snape closely through his half-moon spectacles
and does my evidence count for nothing ? snarled snape
peter pettigrew was not in the shrieking shack , nor did i see any sign of him on the grounds
that was because you were knocked out , professor said hermione earnestly
you did n't arrive in time to hearmiss granger , hold your tonguenow , snape , said fudge , startled , the young lady is disturbed in her mind , we must make allowances -- i would like to speak to harry and hermione alone , said dumbledore abruptly
cornelius , severus , poppy -- please leave us
headmaster sputtered madam pomfrey
they need treatment , they need rest -- this can not wait , said dumbledore
i must insist
madam pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward , slamming the door behind her
fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat
the dementors should have arrived by now , he said
i 'll go and meet them
dumbledore , i 'll see you upstairs
he crossed to the door and held it open for snape , but snape had n't moved
you surely do n't believe a word of black 's story ? snape whispered , his eyes fixed on dumbledore 's face
i wish to speak to harry and hermione alone , dumbledore repeated
snape took a step toward dumbledore
sirius black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen , he breathed
you have n't forgotten that , headmaster ? you have n't forgotten that he once tried to kill me ? my memory is as good as it ever was , severus , said dumbledore quietly
snape turned on his heel and marched through the door fudge was still holding
it closed behind them , and dumbledore turned to harry and hermione
they both burst into speech at the same time
professor , black 's telling the truth -- we saw pettigrew -- he escaped when professor lupin turned into a werewolf -- -- he 's a rat -- -- pettigrew 's front paw , i mean , finger , he cut it off -- -- pettigrew attacked ron , it was n't sirius -- but dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations
it is your turn to listen , and i beg you will not interrupt me , because there is very little time , he said quietly
there is not a shred of proof to support black 's story , except your word -- and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody
a street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw sirius murder pettigrew
i myself gave evidence to the ministry that sirius had been the potters ' secret-keeper
professor lupin can tell you -- harry said , unable to stop himselfprofessor lupin is currently deep in the forest , unable to tell anyone anything
by the time he is human again , it will be too late , sirius will be worse than dead
i might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little -- and the fact that he and sirius are old friends -- but -- listen to me , harry
it is too late , you understand me ? you must see that professor snape 's version of events is far more convincing than yours
he hates sirius , hermione said desperately
all because of some stupid trick sirius played on him -- sirius has not acted like an innocent man
the attack on the fat lady -- entering gryffindor tower with a knife -- without pettigrew , alive or dead , we have no chance of overturning sirius 's sentence
but you believe us
yes , i do , said dumbledore quietly
but i have no power to make other men see the truth , or to overrule the minister of magic
harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away
he had grown used to the idea that dumbledore could solve anything
he had expected dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air
their last hope was gone
what we need , said dumbledore slowly , and his light blue eyes moved from harry to hermione , is more time
but -- hermione began
and then her eyes became very round
ohnow , pay attention , said dumbledore , speaking very low , and very clearly
sirius is locked in professor flitwick 's office on the seventh floor
thirteenth window from the right of the west tower
if all goes well , you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight
but remember this , both of you : you must not be seen
miss granger , you know the law -- you know what is at stake
you -- must -- not -- be -- seen
harry did n't have a clue what was going on
dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door
i am going to lock you in
it is -- he consulted his watch , five minutes to midnight
miss granger , three turns should do it
good luck ? harry repeated as the door closed behind dumbledore
three turns ? what 's he talking about ? what are we supposed to do ? but hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes , pulling from beneath them a very long , very fine gold chain
harry , come here , she said urgently
quickharry moved toward her , completely bewildered
she was holding the chain out
he saw a tiny , sparkling hourglass hanging from it
here -- she had thrown the chain around his neck too
ready ? she said breathlessly
what are we doing ? harry said , completely lost
hermione turned the hourglass over three times
the dark ward dissolved
harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast , backward
a blur of colors and shapes rushed past him , his ears were pounding , he tried to yell but could n't hear his own voice -- and then he felt solid ground beneath his feet , and everything came into focus again -- he was standing next to hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors
he looked wildly around at hermione , the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck
hermione , what -- ? in here hermione seized harry 's arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet ; she opened it , pushed him inside among the buckets and mops , then slammed the door behind them
what -- how -- hermione , what happened ? we 've gone back in time , hermione whispered , lifting the chain off harry 's neck in the darkness
three hours back
harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch
it hurt a lot , which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream
but -- shh listen someone 's coming i think -- i think it might be us hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door
footsteps across the hall
yes , i think it 's us going down to hagrid'sare you telling me , harry whispered , that we 're here in this cupboard and we 're out there too ? yes , said hermione , her ear still glued to the cupboard door
i 'm sure it 's us
it does n't sound like more than three people
and we 're walking slowly because we 're under the invisibility cloak -- she broke off , still listening intently
we 've gone down the front steps
hermione sat down on an upturned bucket , looking desperately anxious , but harry wanted a few questions answered
where did you get that hourglass thing ? it 's called a time-turner , hermione whispered , and i got it from professor mcgonagall on our first day back
i 've been using it all year to get to all my lessons
professor mcgonagall made me swear i would n't tell anyone
she had to write all sorts of letters to the ministry of magic so i could have one
she had to tell them that i was a model student , and that i 'd never , ever use it for anything except my studies
i 've been turning it back so i could do hours over again , that 's how i 've been doing several lessons at once , see ? but
harry , i do n't understand what dumbledore wants us to do
why did he tell us to go back three hours ? how 's that going to help sirius ? harry stared at her shadowy face
there must be something that happened around now he wants us to change , he said slowly
what happened ? we were walking down to hagrid 's three hours ago
this is three hours ago , and we are walking down to hagrid 's , said hermione
we just heard ourselves leaving
harry frowned ; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration
dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent life
and then it hit him
hermione , we 're going to save buckbeakbut -- how will that help sirius ? dumbledore said -- he just told us where the window is -- the window of flitwick 's office where they 've got sirius locked up we 've got to fly buckbeak up to the window and rescue sirius sirius can escape on buckbeak -- they can escape togetherfrom what harry could see of hermione 's face , she looked terrified
if we manage that without being seen , it 'll be a miraclewell , we 've got to try , have n't we ? said harry
he stood up and pressed his ear against the door
does n't sound like anyone 's there
come on , let 's go
harry pushed open the closet door
the entrance hall was deserted
as quietly and quickly as they could , they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps
the shadows were already lengthening , the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest gilded once more with gold
if anyone 's looking out of the window -- hermione squeaked , looking up at the castle behind them
we 'll run for it , said harry determinedly
straight into the forest , all right ? we 'll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout -- okay , but we 'll go around by the greenhouses said hermione breathlessly
we need to keep out of sight of hagrid 's front door , or we 'll see us we must be nearly at hagrid 's by nowstill working out what she meant , harry set off at a sprint , hermione behind him
they tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses , paused for a moment behind them , then set off again , fast as they could , skirting around the whomping willow , tearing toward the shelter of the forest
safe in the shadows of the trees , harry turned around ; seconds later , hermione arrived beside him , panting
right , she gasped
we need to sneak over to hagrid 's
keep out of sight , harry
they made their way silently through the trees , keeping to the very edge of the forest
then , as they glimpsed the front of hagrid 's house , they heard a knock upon his door
they moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side
hagrid had appeared in his doorway , shaking and white , looking around to see who had knocked
and harry heard his own voice
we 're wearing the invisibility cloak
let us in and we can take it off
yeh shouldn 've come hagrid whispered
he stood back , then shut the door quickly
this is the weirdest thing we 've ever done , harry said fervently
let 's move along a bit , hermione whispered
we need to get nearer to buckbeakthey crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff , tethered to the fence around hagrid 's pumpkin patch
now ? harry whispered
no said hermione
if we steal him now , those committee people will think hagrid set him free we 've got to wait until they 've seen he 's tied outsidethat 's going to give us about sixty seconds , said harry
this was starting to seem impossible
at that moment , there was a crash of breaking china from inside hagrid 's cabin
that 's hagrid breaking the milk jug , hermione whispered
i 'm going to find scabbers in a moment -- sure enough , a few minutes later , they heard hermione 's shriek of surprise
hermione , said harry suddenly , what if we -- we just run in there and grab pettigrew -- no said hermione in a terrified whisper
do n't you understand ? we 're breaking one of the most important wizarding laws nobody 's supposed to change time , nobody you heard dumbledore , if we 're seen -- we 'd only be seen by ourselves and hagridharry , what do you think you 'd do if you saw yourself bursting into hagrid 's house ? said hermione
i 'd -- i 'd think i 'd gone mad , said harry , or i 'd think there was some dark magic going on -- exactly you would n't understand , you might even attack yourself do n't you see ? professor mcgonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time
loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistakeokay said harry
it was just an idea , i just thoughtbut hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle
harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors
dumbledore , fudge , the old committee member , and macnair the executioner were coming down the steps
we 're about to come out hermione breathed
and sure enough , moments later , hagrid 's back door opened , and harry saw himself , ron , and hermione walking out of it with hagrid
it was , without a doubt , the strangest sensation of his life , standing behind the tree , and watching himself in the pumpkin patch
it 's okay , beaky , it 's okay
hagrid said to buckbeak
then he turned to harry , ron , and hermione
hagrid , we ca n't -- we 'll tell them what really happenedthey ca n't kill him -- go it 's bad enough without you lot in trouble an ' allharry watched the hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the invisibility cloak over him and ron
there was a knock on hagrid 's front door
the execution party had arrived
hagrid turned , around and headed back into his cabin , leaving the back door ajar
harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating
he , ron , and hermione had gone
but the harry and hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door
where is the beast ? came the cold voice of macnair
out -- outside , hagrid croaked
harry pulled his head out of sight as macnair 's face appeared at hagrid 's window , staring out at buckbeak
then they heard fudge
we -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution , hagrid
i 'll make it quick
and then you and macnair need to sign it
macnair , you 're supposed to listen too , that 's procedure -- macnair 's face vanished from the window
it was now or never
wait here , harry whispered to hermione
i 'll do it
as fudge 's voice started again , harry darted out from behind his tree , vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch , and approached buckbeak
it is the decision of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures that the hippogriff buckbeak , hereafter called the condemned , shall he executed on the sixth of june at sundown -- careful not to blink , harry stared up into buckbeak 's fierce orange eyes once more and bowed
buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again
harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying buckbeak to the fence
sentenced to execution by beheading , to be carried out by the committee 's appointed executioner , walden macnai
come on , buckbeak , harry murmured , come on , we 're going to help you
as witnessed below
hagrid , you sign here
harry threw all his weight onto the rope , but buckbeak had dug in his front feet
well , let 's get this over with , said the reedy voice of the committee member from inside hagrid 's cabin
hagrid , perhaps it will be better if you stay inside -- no , i -- i wan ' ter be with him
i don ' wan ' him ter be alone -- footsteps echoed from within the cabin
buckbeak , move harry hissed
harry tugged harder on the rope around buckbeak 's neck
the hippogriff began to walk , rustling its wings irritably
they were still ten feet away from the forest , in plain view of hagrid 's back door
one moment , please , macnair , came dumbledore 's voice
you need to sign too
the footsteps stopped
harry heaved on the rope
buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster
hermione 's white face was sticking out from behind a tree
harry , hurry she mouthed
harry could still hear dumbledore 's voice talking from within the cabin
he gave the rope another wrench
buckbeak broke into a grudging trot
they had reached the trees
quick quick hermione moaned , darting out from behind her tree , seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make buckbeak move faster
harry looked over his shoulder ; they were now blocked from sight ; they could n't see hagrid 's garden at all
stop he whispered to hermione
they might hear ushagrid 's back door had opened with a bang
harry , hermione , and buckbeak stood quite still ; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently
then -- where is it ? said the reedy voice of the committee member
where is the beast ? it was tied here said the executioner furiously
i saw it just herehow extraordinary , said dumbledore
there was a note of amusement in his voice
beaky said hagrid huskily
there was a swishing noise , and the thud of an axe
the executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger
and then came the howling , and this time they could hear hagrid 's words through his sobs
gone gone bless his little beak , he 's gone musta pulled himself free beaky , yeh clever boybuckbeak started to strain against the rope , trying to get back to hagrid
harry and hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him
someone untied him the executioner was snarling
we should search the grounds , the forest
macnair , if buckbeak has indeed been stolen , do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot ? said dumbledore , still sounding amused
search the skies , if you will
hagrid , i could do with a cup of tea
or a large brandy
o ' -- o ' course , professor , said hagrid , who sounded weak with happiness
come in , come in
harry and hermione listened closely
they heard footsteps , the soft cursing of the executioner , the snap of the door , and then silence once more
now what ? whispered harry , looking around
we 'll have to hide in here , said hermione , who looked very shaken
we need to wait until they 've gone back to the castle
then we wait until it 's safe to fly buckbeak up to sirius 's window
he wo n't be there for another couple of hours
oh , this is going to be difficult
she looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest
the sun was setting now
we 're going to have to move , said harry , thinking hard
we 've got to be able to see the whomping willow , or we wo n't know what 's going on
okay , said hermione , getting a firmer grip on buckbeak 's rope
but we 've got to keep out of sight , harry , remember
they moved around the edge of the forest , darkness falling thickly around them , until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the willow
there 's ron said harry suddenly
a dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air
get away from him -- get away -- scabbers , come here -- and then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere
harry watched himself and hermione chasing after ron
then he saw ron dive
gotcha get off , you stinking cat -- there 's sirius said harry
the great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the willow
they saw him bowl harry over , then seize ron
looks even worse from here , does n't it ? said harry , watching the dog pulling ron into the roots
ouch -- look , i just got walloped by the tree -- and so did you -- this is weird -- the whomping willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches ; they could see themselves darting here and there , trying to reach the trunk
and then the tree froze
that was crookshanks pressing the knot , said hermione
and there we go
the moment they disappeared , the tree began to move again
seconds later , they heard footsteps quite close by
dumbledore , macnair , fudge , and the old committee member were making their way up to the castle
right after we 'd gone down into the passage said hermione
if only dumbledore had come with us
macnair and fudge would 've come too , said harry bitterly
i bet you anything fudge would 've told macnair to murder sirius on the spot
they watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view
for a few minutes the scene was deserted
then -- here comes lupin said harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and hating toward the willow
harry looked up at the sky
clouds were obscuring the moon completely
they watched lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk
the tree stopped fighting , and lupin , too , disappeared into the gap in its roots
if he 'd only grabbed the cloak , said harry
it 's just lying there
he turned to hermione
if i just dashed out now and grabbed it , snape 'd never be able to get it and -- harry , we must n't be seenhow can you stand this ? he asked hermione fiercely
just standing here and watching it happen ? he hesitated
i 'm going to grab the cloakharry , nohermione seized the back of harry 's robes not a moment too soon
just then , they heard a burst of song
it was hagrid , making his way up to the castle , singing at the top of his voice , and weaving slightly as he walked
a large bottle was swinging from his hands
see ? hermione whispered
see what would have happened ? we 've got to keep out of sight no , buckbeakthe hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to hagrid again ; harry seized his rope too , straining to hold buckbeak back
they watched hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle
he was gone
buckbeak stopped fighting to get away
his head drooped sadly
barely two minutes later , the castle doors flew open yet again , and snape came charging out of them , running toward the willow
harry 's fists clenched as they watched snape skid to a halt next to the tree , looking around
he grabbed the cloak and held it up
get your filthy hands off it , harry snarled under his breath
shhsnape seized the branch lupin had used to freeze the tree , prodded the knot , and vanished from view as he put on the cloak
so that 's it , said hermione quietly
we 're all down there
and now we 've just got to wait until we come back up again
she took the end of buckbeak 's rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree , then sat down on the dry ground , arms around her knees
harry , there 's something i do n't understand
why did n't the dementors get sirius ? i remember them coming , and then i think i passed out
there were so many of them
harry sat down too
he explained what he 'd seen ; how , as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to harry 's , a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat
hermione 's mouth was slightly open by the time harry had finished
but what was it ? there 's only one thing it could have been , to make the dementors go , said harry
a real patronus
a powerful one
but who conjured it ? harry did n't say anything
he was thinking back to the person he 'd seen on the other bank of the lake
he knew who he thought it had been
but how could it have been ? did n't you see what they looked like ? said hermione eagerly
was it one of the teachers ? no , said harry
he was n't a teacher
but it must have been a really powerful wizard , to drive all those dementors away
if the patronus was shining so brightly , did n't it light him up ? could n't you see -- ? yeah , i saw him , said harry slowly
maybe i imagined it
i was n't thinking straight
i passed out right afterward
who did you think it was ? i think -- harry swallowed , knowing how strange this was going to sound
i think it was my dad
harry glanced up at hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now
she was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity
harry , your dad 's -- well -- dead , she said quietly
i know that , said harry quickly
you think you saw his ghost ? i do n't know
he looked solid
but then -- maybe i was seeing things , said harry
from what i could see
it looked like him
i 've got photos of him
hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity
i know it sounds crazy , said harry flatly
he turned to took at buckbeak , who was digging his beak into the ground , apparently searching for worms
but he was n't really watching buckbeak
he was thinking about his father and about his father 's three oldest friends
moony , wormtail , padfoot , and prongs
had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight ? wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead
was it so impossible his father had done the same ? had he been seeing things across the take ? the figure had been too far away to see distinctly
yet he had felt sure , for a moment , before he 'd lost consciousness
the leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze
the moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds
hermione sat with her face turned toward the willow , waiting
and then , at last , after over an hour
here we come hermione whispered
she and harry got to their feet
buckbeak raised his head
they saw lupin , ron , and pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots
then came hermione
then the unconscious snape , drifting weirdly upward
next came harry and black
they all began to walk toward the castle
harry 's heart was starting to beat very fast
he glanced up at the sky
any moment now , that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon
harry , hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking , we 've got to stay put
we must n't be seen
there 's nothing we can do
so we 're just going to let pettigrew escape all over again
said harry quietly
how do you expect to find a rat in the dark ? snapped hermione
there 's nothing we can do we came back to help sirius ; we 're not supposed to be doing anything elseall rightthe moon slid out from behind its cloud
they saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop
then they saw movement -- there goes lupin , hermione whispered
he 's transforminghermione said harry suddenly
we 've got to movewe must n't , i keep telling you -- not to interfere lupin 's going to run into the forest , right at ushermione gasped
quick she moaned , dashing to untie buckbeak
quick where are we going to go ? where are we going to hide ? the dementors wilt be coming any moment -- back to hagrid 's harry said
it 's empty now -- come onthey ran as fast as they could , buckbeak cantering along behind them
they could hear the werewolf howling behind them
the cabin was in sight ; harry skidded to the door , wrenched it open , and hermione and buckbeak flashed past him ; harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door
fang the boarhound barked loudly
shh , fang , it 's us said hermione , hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him
that was really close she said to harry
harry was looking out of the window
it was much harder to see what was going on from here
buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside hagrid 's house
he lay down in front of the fire , folded his wings contentedly , and seemed ready for a good nap
i think i 'd better go outside again , you know , said harry slowly
i ca n't see what 's going on -- we wo n't know when it 's time -- hermione looked up
her expression was suspicious
i 'm not going to try and interfere , said harry quickly
but if we do n't see what 's going on , how 're we going to know when it 's time to rescue sirius ? well
i 'll wait here with buckbeak
but harry , be careful -- there 's a werewolf out there -- and the dementorsharry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin
he could hear yelping in the distance
that meant the dementors were closing in on sirius
he and hermione would be running to him any moment
harry stared out toward the lake , his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest
whoever had sent that patronus would be appearing at any moment
for a fraction of a second he stood , irresolute , in front of hagrid 's door
you must not be seen
but he did n't want to be seen
he wanted to do the seeing
he had to know
and there were the dementors
they were emerging out of the darkness from every direction , gliding around the edges of the lake
they were moving away from where harry stood , to the opposite bank
he would n't have to get near them
harry began to run
he had no thought in his head except his father
if it was him
if it really was him
he had to know , had to find out
the lake was coming nearer and nearer , but there was no sign of anybody
on the opposite bank , he could see tiny glimmers of silver -- his own attempts at a patronus -- there was a bush at the very edge of the water
harry threw himself behind it , peering desperately through the leaves
on the opposite bank , the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished
a terrified excitement shot through him -- any moment now -- come on he muttered , staring about
where are you ? dad , come on -- but no one came
harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake
one of them was lowering its hood
it was time for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help this time -- and then it hit him -- he understood
he had n't seen his father -- he had seen himself -- harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand
expecto patronum he yelled
and out of the end of his wand burst , not a shapeless cloud of mist , but a blinding , dazzling , silver animal
he screwed up his eyes , trying to see what it was
it looked like a horse
it was galloping silently away from him , across the black surface of the lake
he saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors
now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground , and the dementors were falling back , scattering , retreating into the darkness
they were gone
the patronus turned
it was cantering back toward harry across the still surface of the water
it was n't a horse
it was n't a unicorn , either
it was a stag
it was shining brightly as the moon above
it was coming back to him
it stopped on the bank
its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at harry with its large , silver eyes
slowly , it bowed its antlered head
and harry realized
prongs , he whispered
but as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature , it vanished
harry stood there , hand still outstretched
then , with a great leap of his heart , he heard hooves behind him -he whirled around and saw hermione dashing toward him , dragging buckbeak behind her
what did you do ? she said fiercely
you said you were only going to keep a lookouti just saved all our lives
, said harry
get behind here -- behind this bush -- i 'll explain
hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again
did anyone see you ? yes , have n't you been listening ? i saw me but i thought i was my dad it 's okayharry , i ca n't believe it
you conjured up a patronus that drove away all those dementors that 's very , very advanced magic
i knew i could do it this time , said harry , because i 'd already done it
does that make sense ? i do n't know -- harry , look at snapetogether they peered around the bush at the other bank
snape had regained consciousness
he was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of harry , hermione , and black onto them
a fourth stretcher , no doubt bearing ron , was already floating at his side
then , wand held out in front of him , he moved them away toward the castle
right , it 's nearly time , said hermione tensely , looking at her watch
we 've got about forty-five minutes until dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing
we 've got to rescue sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we 're missing
_num_they waited , watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake , while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze
buckbeak , bored , was ferreting for worms again
d ' you reckon he 's up there yet ? said harry , checking his watch
he looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the west tower
look hermione whispered
\who 's that ? someone 's coming back out of the castleharry stared through the darkness
the man was hurrying across the grounds , toward one of the entrances
something shiny glinted in his belt
macnair said harry
the executioner he 's gone to get the dementors this is it , hermione -- hermione put her hands on buckbeak 's back and harry gave her a leg up
then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her
he pulled buckbeak 's rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins
ready ? he whispered to hermione
yotm better hold on to me -- he nudged buckbeak 's sides with his heels
buckbeak soared straight into the dark air
harry gripped his flanks with his knees , feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them
hermione was holding harry very tight around the waist ; he could hear her muttering , oh , no -- i do n't like this oh , i really do n't like this -- harry urged buckbeak forward
they were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle
harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the rope , and buckbeak turned
harry was trying to count the windows flashing past -- whoa he said , pulling backward as hard as he could
buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop , unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne
he 's there harry said , spotting sirius as they rose up beside the window
he reached out , and as buckbeak 's wings fell , was able to tap sharply on the glass
black looked up
harry saw his jaw drop
he leapt from his chair , hurried to the window and tried to open it , but it was locked
stand back hermione called to him , and she took out her wand , still gripping the back of harry 's robes with her left hand
alohomorathe window sprang open
how -- how -- ? said black weakly , staring at the hippogriffget on -- there 's not much time , said harry , gripping buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady
you 've got to get out of here -the dementors are coming -- macnair 's gone to get them
black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it
it was very lucky he was so thin
in seconds , he had managed to fling one leg over buckbeak 's back and pull himself onto the hippogriff behind hermione
okay , buckbeak , up said harry , shaking the rope
up to the tower -- come on
the hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again , high as the top of the west tower
buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements , and harry and hermione slid off him at once
sirius , you 'd better go , quick , harry panted
they 'll reach flitwick 's office any moment , they 'll find out you 're gone
buckbeak pawed the ground , tossing his sharp head
what happened to the other boy ? ron ? croaked sirius
he 's going to be okay
he 's still out of it , but madam pomfrey says she 'll be able to make him better
quick -- go -- but black was still staring down at harry
how can i ever thank -- go harry and hermione shouted together
black wheeled buckbeak around , facing the open sky
we 'll see each other again , he said
you are -- truly your father 's son , harry
he squeezed buckbeak 's sides with his heels
harry and hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more
the hippogriff took off into the air
he and his rider became smaller and smaller as harry gazed after them
then a cloud drifted across the moon
they were gone
chapter twenty-twoowl post againharryhermione was tugging at his sleeve , staring at her watch
we 've got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us -- before dumbledore locks the door -- okay , said harry , wrenching his gaze from the sky , let 's go
they slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase
as they reached the bottom of it , they heard voices
they flattened themselves against the wall and listened
it sounded like fudge and snape
they were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase
only hope dumbledore 's not going to make difficulties , snape was saying
the kiss will be performed immediately ? as soon as macnair returns with the dementors
this whole black affair has been highly embarrassing
i ca n't tell you how much i 'm looking forward to informing the daily prophet that we 've got him at last
i daresay they 'll want to interview you , snape
and once young harry 's back in his right mind , i expect he 'll want to tell the prophet exactly how you saved him
harry clenched his teeth
he caught a glimpse of snape 's smirk as he and fudge passed harry and hermione 's hiding place
their footsteps died away
harry and hermione waited a few moments to make sure they 'd really gone , then started to run in the opposite direction
down one staircase , then another , along a new , corridor -- then they heard a cackling ahead
peeves harry muttered , grabbing hermione 's wrist
in herethey tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time
peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits , laughing his head off
oh , he 's horrible , whispered hermione , her ear to the door
i bet he 's all excited because the dementors are going to finish off sirius
she checked her watch
three minutes , harrythey waited until peeves 's gloating voice had faded into the distance , then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again
hermione -- what 'll happen -- if we do n't get back inside before dumbledore locks the door ? harry panted
i do n't want to think about it hermione moaned , checking her watch again
one minutethey had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance
okay -- i can hear dumbledore , said hermione tensely
come on , harrythey crept along the corridor
the door opened
dumbledore 's back appeared
i am going to lock you in , they heard him saying
it is five minutes to midnight
miss granger , three turns should do it
dumbledore backed out of the room , closed the door , and took out his wand to magically lock it
panicking , harry and hermione ran forward
dumbledore looked up , and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache
well ? he said quietly
we did it said harry breathlessly
sirius has gone , on buckbeak
dumbledore beamed at them
i think -- he listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing
yes , i think you 've gone too -- get inside -- i 'll lock you in -- harry and hermione slipped back inside the dormitory
it was empty except for ron , who was still lying motionless in the end bed
as the lock clicked behind them , harry and hermione crept back to their own beds , hermione tucking the time-turner back under her robes
a moment later , madam pomfrey came striding back out of her office
did i hear the headmaster leaving ? am i allowed to look after my patients now ? she was in a very bad mood
harry and hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly
madam pomfrey stood over them , making sure they ate it
but harry could hardly swallow
he and hermione were waiting , listening , their nerves jangling
and then , as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from madam pomfrey , they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them
what was that ? said madam pomfrey in alarm
now they could hear angry voices , growing louder and louder
madam pomfrey was staring at the door
really -- they 'll wake everybody up what do they think they 're doing ? harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying
they were drawing nearer -- he must have disapparated , severus
we should have left somebody in the room with him
when this gets out -- he did n't disapparate snape roared , now very close at hand
you ca n't apparate or disapparate inside this castle this -- has -- something -- to -- do -- with -- potterseverus -- be reasonable -- harry has been locked up -- bam
the door of the hospital wing burst open
fudge , snape , and dumbledore came striding into the ward
dumbledore alone looked calm
indeed , he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself
fudge appeared angry
but snape was beside himself
out with it , potter he bellowed
what did you do ? professor snape shrieked madam pomfrey
control yourselfsee here , snape , be reasonable , said fudge
this door 's been locked , we just saw -- they helped him escape , i know it snape howled , pointing at harry and hermione
his face was twisted ; spit was flying from his mouth
calm down , man fudge barked
you 're talking nonsenseyou do n't know potter shrieked snape
he did it , i know he did it -- that will do , severus , said dumbledore quietly
think about what you are saying
this door has been locked since i left the ward ten minutes ago
madam pomfrey , have these students left their beds ? of course not said madam pomfrey , bristling
i would have heard themwell , there you have it , severus , said dumbledore calmly
unless you are suggesting that harry and hermione are able to be in two places at once , i 'm afraid i do n't see any point in troubling them further
snape stood there , seething , staring from fudge , who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior , to dumbledore , whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses
snape whirled about , robes swishing behind him , and stormed out of the ward
fellow seems quite unbalanced , said fudge , staring after him
i 'd watch out for him if i were you , dumbledore
oh , he 's not unbalanced , said dumbledore quietly
he 's just suffered a severe disappointment
he 's not the only one puffed fudge
the daily prophet 's going to have a field day we had black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again all it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff 's escape to get out , and i 'll be a laughingstock well
i 'd better go and notify the ministry
and the dementors ? said dumbledore
they 'll be removed from the school , i trust ? oh yes , they 'll have to go , said fudge , running his fingersdistractedly through his hair
never dreamed they 'd attempt to administer the kiss on an innocent boy
completely out of control
no , i 'll have them packed off back to azkaban tonight
perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance
hagrid would like that , said dumbledore , smiling at harry and hermione
as he and fudge left the dormitory , madam pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again
muttering angrily to herself , she headed back to her office
there was a low moan from the other end of the ward
ron had woken up
they could see him sitting up , rubbing his head , looking around
what -- what happened ? he groaned
harry ? why are we in here ? where 's sirius ? where 's lupin ? what 's going on ? harry and hermione looked at each other
you explain , said harry , helping himself to some more chocolate
when harry , ron , and hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day , it was to find an almost deserted castle
the sweltering , heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another hogsmeade visit
neither ron nor hermione felt like going , however , so they and harry wandered onto the grounds , still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where sirius and buckbeak were now
sitting near the lake , watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water , harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank
the stag had galloped toward him from there just last night
a shadow fell across them and they looked 'tip to see a very bleary-eyed hagrid , mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them
know i shouldn ' feel happy , after wha ' happened las ' night , he said
i mean , black escapin ' again , an , everythin ' -- but guess what ? what ? they said , pretending to look curious
beaky he escaped he 's free bin celebratin ' all nightthat 's wonderful said hermione , giving ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing
can't 've tied him up properly , said hagrid , gazing happily out over the grounds
i was worried this mornin ' , mind
thought he mighta met professor lupin on the grounds , but lupin says he never ate anythin ' las ' night
what ? said harry quickly
blimey , haven ' yeh heard ? said hagrid , his smile fading a little
he lowered his voice , even though there was nobody in sight
er -- snape told all the slytherins this mornin
thought everyone 'd know by now
professor lupin 's a werewolf , see
an ' he was loose on the grounds las ' night
he 's packin ' now , o ' course
he 's packing ? said harry , alarmed
why ? leavin ' , isn ' he ? said hagrid , looking surprised that harry had to ask
resigned firs ' thing this mornin
says he ca n't risk it happenin again
harry scrambled to his feet
i 'm going to see him , he said to ron and hermione
but if he 's resigned -- -- does n't sound like there 's anything we can do -- i do n't care
i still want to see him
i 'll meet you back here
lupin 's office door was open
he had already packed most of his things
the grindylow 's empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase , which was open and nearly full
lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when harry knocked on the door
i saw you coming , said lupin , smiling
he pointed to the parchment he had been poring over
it was the marauder 's map
i just saw hagrid , said harry
and he said you 'd resigned
it 's not true , is it ? i 'm afraid it is , said lupin
he started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents
why ? said harry
the ministry of magic do n't think you were helping sirius , do they ? lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind harry
professor dumbledore managed to convince fudge that i was trying to save your lives
that was the final straw for severus
i think the loss of the order of merlin hit him hard
so he -- er -- accidentally let slip that i am a werewolf this morning at breakfast
you 're not leaving just because of that said harry
lupin smiled wryly
this time tomorrow , the owls will start arriving from parents
they will not want a werewolf teaching their children , harry
and after last night , i see their point
i could have bitten any of you
that must never happen again
you 're the best defense against the dark arts- teacher we 've ever had said harry
do n't golupin shook his head and did n't speak
he carried on emptying his drawers
then , while harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay , lupin said , from what the headmaster told me this morning , you saved a lot of lives last night , harry
if i 'm proud of anything i 've done this year , it 's how much you 've learned
tell me about your patronus
how d'you know about that ? said harry , distracted
what else could have driven the dementors back ? harry told lupin what had happened
when he 'd finished , lupin was smiling again
yes , your father was always a stag when he transformed , he said
you guessed right
that 's why we called him prongs
lupin threw his last few books into his case , closed the desk drawers , and turned to look at harry
here -- i brought this from the shrieking shack last night , he said , handing harry back the invisibility cloak
he hesitated , then held out the marauder 's map too
i am no longer your teacher , so i do n't feel guilty about giving you back this as well
it 's no use to me , and i daresay you , ron , and hermione will find uses for it
harry took the map and grinned
you told me moony , wormtail , padfoot , and prongs would 've wanted to lure me out of school
you said they 'd have thought it was funny
and so we would have , said lupin , now reaching down to close his case
i have no hesitation in saying that james would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle
there was a knock on the door
harry hastily stuffed the marauder 's map and the invisibility cloak into his pocket
it was professor dumbledore
he did n't look surprised to see harry there
your carriage is at the gates , remus , he said
thank you , headmaster
lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank
well -- good-bye , harry , he said , smiling
it has been a real pleasure teaching you
i feel sure we 'll meet again sometime
headmaster , there is no need to see me to the gates , i can manage
harry had the impression that lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible
good-bye , then , remus , said dumbledore soberly
lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and dumbledore could shake hands
then , with a final nod to harry and a swift smile , lupin left the office
harry sat down in his vacated chair , staring glumly at the floor
he heard the door close and looked up
dumbledore was still there
why so miserable , harry ? he said quietly
you should be very proud of yourself after last night
it did n't make any difference , said harry bitterly
pettigrew got away
did n't make any difference ? said dumbledore quietly , it made all the difference in the world , harry
you helped uncover the truth
