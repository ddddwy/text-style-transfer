You know , I 'm starting to think Hermione was right about her -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead -- she 's a right old fraud
Yeah , said Harry , looking at his own watch
It-was now two o'clock
Wish she 'd hurry up
Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride
She says I 've got all the makings of a true Seer , she informed Harry and Ron
I saw loads of stuff
Well , good luckShe hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender
Ronald Weasley , said the familiar , misty voice from over their heads
Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight
Harry was now the only person left to be tested
He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall , listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window , his mind across the grounds with Hagrid
Finally , after about twenty minutes , Ron 's large feet reappeared on the ladder
How 'd it go ? Harry asked him , standing up
Rubbish , said Ron
Could n't see a thing , so I made some stuff up
Do n't think she was convinced , though
Meet you in the common room , Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney 's voice called , Harry PotterThe tower room was hotter than ever before ; the curtains were closed , the fire was alight , and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball
Good day , my dear , she said softly
If you would kindly gaze into the Orb
Take your time , now
then tell me what you see within it
Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared , stared as hard as he could , willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog , but nothing happened
Well ? Professor Trelawney prompted delicately
What do you see ? The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them
He thought of what Ron had just said , and decided to pretend
Er -- said Harry , a dark shape
What does it resemble ? whispered Professor Trelawney
Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak
A hippogriff , he said firmly
Indeed whispered Professor Trelawney , scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees
My boy , you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid 's trouble with the Ministry of Magic Look closer
Does the hippogriff appear to
have its head ? Yes , said Harry firmly
Are you sure ? Professor Trelawney urged him
Are you quite sure , dear ? You do n't see it writhing on the ground , perhaps , and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it ? No said Harry , starting to feel slightly sick
No blood ? No weeping Hagrid ? No said Harry again , wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat
It looks fine , it 's - - flying away
Professor Trelawney sighed
Well , dear , I think we 'll leave it there
A little disappointing
but I 'm sure you did your best
Relieved , Harry got up , picked up his bag and turned to go , but then a loud , harsh voice spoke behind him
IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT
Harry wheeled around
Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair ; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging
S -- sorry ? said Harry
But Professor Trelawney did n't seem to hear him
Her eyes started to roll
Harry sat there in a panic
She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure
He hesitated , thinking of running to the hospital wing -- and then Professor Trelawney spoke again , in the same harsh voice , quite unlike her own : THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS , ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS
HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS
TONIGHT , BEFORE MIDNIGHT
THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS MASTER
THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANTS AID , GREATER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS
WILL SET OU
Professor Trelawney 's head fell forward onto her chest
She made a grunting sort of noise
Harry sat there , staring at her
Then , quite suddenly , Professor Trelawney 's head snapped up again
I 'm so sorry , dear boy , she said dreamily , the heat of the day , you know
I drifted off for a moment
Harry sat there , staring at her
Is there anything wrong , my dear ? You -- you just told me that the -- the Dark Lord 's going to rise again
that his servant 's going to go back to him
Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled
The Dark Lord ? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named ? My dear boy , that 's hardly something to joke about
Rise again , indeed -- , 'But you just said it You
said the Dark Lord -- I think you must have dozed off too , dear said Professor Trelawney
I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched as thatHarry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase , wondering
had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real prediction ? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test ? Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower , Professor Trelawney 's words still resounding in his head
People were striding past him in the opposite direction , laughing and joking , heading for the grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom ; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room , it was almost deserted
Over in the corner , however , sat Ron and Hermione
Professor Trelawney , Harry panted , just told me -- But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces
Buckbeak lost , said Ron weakly
Hagrid 's just sent this
Hagrid 's note was dry this time , no tears had splattered it , yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible
They 're going to execute at sunset
Nothing you can do
Do n't come down
I do n't want you to see it
HagridWe 've got to go , said Harry at once
He ca n't just sit there on his own , waiting for the executionerSunset , though , said Ron , who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way
We 'd never be allowed
specially you , Harry
Harry sank his head into his hands , thinking
If we only had the Invisibility Cloak
Where is it ? said Hermione
Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed witch
if Snape sees me anywhere near there again , I 'm in serious trouble , he finished
That 's true , said Hermione , getting to her feet
If he sees you
How do you open the witch 's hump again ? You -- you tap it and say , 'Dissendium , ' said Harry
But -- Hermione did n't wait for the rest of his sentence ; she strode across the room , pushed open the Fat Lady 's portrait and vanished from sight
She has n't gone to get it ? Ron said , staring after her
Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes
Hermione , I do n't know what 's gotten , into you lately said Ron , astounded
First you hit Malfoy , then you walk out on Professor Trelawney -- Hermione looked rather flattered
They went down to dinner with everybody else , but did not return to Gryffindor Tower afterward
Harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of his robes ; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump
They skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall , listening , until they were sure it was deserted
They heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming
Hermione poked her head around the door
Okay , she whispered , no one there -- cloak on -- Walking very close together so that nobody would see them , they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak , then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds
The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden Forest , gilding the top branches of the trees
They reached Hagrid 's cabin and knocked
He was a minute in answering , and when he did , he looked all around for his visitor , pale-faced and trembling
It 's us , Harry hissed
We 're wearing the Invisibility Cloak
Let us in and we can take it off
Yeh shouldn 've come Hagrid whispered , but he stood back , and they stepped inside
Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak
Hagrid was not crying , nor did he throw himself upon their necks
He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do
This helplessness was worse to watch than tears
Wan ' some tea ? he said
His great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle
Where 's Buckbeak , Hagrid ? said Hermione hesitantly
I -- I took him outside , said Hagrid , spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug
He 's tethered in me pumpkin patch
Thought he oughta see the trees an ' -- an ' smell fresh air -- beforeHagrid 's hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor
I 'll do it , Hagrid , said Hermione quickly , hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess
There 's another one in the cupboard , Hagrid said , sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve
Harry glanced at Ron , who looked back hopelessly
Is n't there anything anyone can do , Hagrid ? Harry asked fiercely , sitting down next to him
Dumbledore -- He 's tried , said Hagrid
He 's got no power ter overrule the Committee
He told 'em Buckbeak 's all right , but they 're scared
Yeh know what Lucius Malfoy 's like
threatened 'em , I expect
an ' the executioner , Macnair , he 's an old pal o ' Malfoy 's
but it 'll be quick an ' clean
an ' I 'll be beside him
His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort
Dumbledore 's gon na come down while it -- while it happens
Wrote me this mornin
Said he wants ter -- ter be with me
Great man , Dumbledore
Hermione , who had been rummaging in Hagrid 's cupboard for another milk jug , let out a small , quickly stifled sob
She straightened up with the new jug in her hands , fighting back tears
We 'll stay with you too , Hagrid , she began , but Hagrid shook his shaggy head
Yeh 're ter go back up ter the castle
I told yeh , I don ' wan ' yeh watchin
An ' yeh shouldn ' be down here anyway
If Fudge an ' Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission , Harry , yeh 'll be in big trouble
Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione 's face , but she hid them from Hagrid , bustling around making tea
Then , as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug , she let out a shriek
Ron , I do n't believe it -- it 's ScabbersRon gaped at her
What are you talking about ? Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down
With a frantic squeak , and much scrambling to get back inside , Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table
Scabbers said Ron blankly
Scabbers , what are you doing here ? He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light
Scabbers looked dreadful
He was thinner than ever , large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches , and he writhed in Ron 's hands as though desperate to free himselfIt 's okay , Scabbers said Ron
No cats There 's nothing here to hurt youHagrid suddenly stood up , his eyes fixed on the window
His normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment
Harry , Ron , and Hermione whipped around
A group of men was walking down the distant castle steps
In front was Albus Dumbledore , his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun
Next to him trotted Cornelius Fudge
Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner , Macnair
Yeh got ta go , said Hagrid
Every inch of him was trembling
They mustn ' find yeh here
Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak
I 'll let yeh out the back way , said Hagrid
They followed him to the door into his back garden
Harry felt strangely unreal , and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away , tethered to a tree behind Hagrid 's Pumpkin patch
Buckbeak seemed to know something was happening
He turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously
It 's okay , Beaky , said Hagrid softly
He turned to Harry , Ron , and Hermione
Go on , he said
But they did n't move
Hagrid , we ca n't -- We 'll tell them what really happened -- They ca n't kill him -- Go said Hagrid fiercely
It 's bad enough without you lot in trouble an ' allThey had no choice
As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron , they heard voices at the front of the cabin
Hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight
Go quick , he said hoarsely
And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door
Slowly , in a kind of horrified trance , Harry , Ron , and Hermione set off silently around Hagrid 's house
As they reached the other side , the front door closed with a sharp snap
Please , let 's hurry , Hermione whispered
I ca n't stand it , I ca n't bear it
They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle
The sun was sinking fast now ; the sky had turned to a clear , purple-tinged grey , but to the west there was a ruby-red glow
Ron stopped dead
Oh , please , Ron , Hermione began
It 's Scabbers -- he wo n't -- stay put -- Ron was bent over , trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket , but the rat was going berserk ; squeaking madly , twisting and flailing , trying to sink his teeth into Ron 's hand
Scabbers , it 's me , you idiot , it 's Ron , Ron hissed
They heard a door open behind them and men 's voices
Oh , Ron , please let 's move , they 're going to do it Hermione breathed
Okay -- Scabbers , stay put -- They walked forward ; Harry , like Hermione , was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them
Ron stopped again
I ca n't hold him -- Scabbers , shut up , everyone 'll hear us -- The rat was squealing wildly , but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid 's garden
There was a jumble of indistinct male voices , a silence , and then , without warning , the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe
Hermione swayed on the spot
They did it she whispered to Harry
I d -- do n't believe it -- they did itCHAPTER SEVENTEENCAT , RAT , AND DOGHarry 's mind had gone blank with shock
The three of them stood transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak
The very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long- shadowed grounds
Then , behind them , they heard a wild howling
Hagrid , Harry muttered
Without thinking about what he was doing , he made to turn back , but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms
We ca n't , said Ron , who was paper-white
He 'll be in worse trouble if they know we 've been to see him
Hermione 's breathing was shallow and uneven
How -- could -- they ? she choked
How could they ? Come on , said Ron , whose teeth seemed to be chattering
They set off back toward the castle , walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak
The light was fading fast now
By the time they reached open ground , darkness was settling like a spell around them
Scabbers , keep still , Ron hissed , clamping his hand over his chest
The rat was wriggling madly
Ron came to a sudden halt , trying to force Scabbers deeper into his pocket
What 's the matter with you , You stupid rat ? Stay still -- OUCH He bit meRon , be quiet Hermione whispered urgently
Fudge 'll be out here in a minute -- He wo n't -- stay -- put -- Scabbers was plainly terrified
He was writhing with all his might , trying to break free of Ron 's grip
What 's the matter with him ? But Harry had just seen -- stinking toward them , his body low to the ground , wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness -- Crookshanks
Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers 's squeaks , Harry could n't tell
Crookshanks Hermione moaned
No , go away , Crookshanks Go awayBut the cat was getting nearer -- Scabbers -- NOToo late -- the rat had slipped between Ron 's clutching fingers , hit the ground , and scampered away
In one bound , Crookshanks sprang after him , and before Harry or Hermione could stop him , Ron had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness
Ron Hermione moaned
She and Harry looked at each other , then followed at a sprint ; it as impossible to run full out under the cloak ; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron ; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks
Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers , come here -- There was a loud thud
Gotcha Get off , you stinking cat -- Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron ; they skidded to a stop right in front of him
He was sprawled on the ground , but Scabbers was back in his pocket ; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump
Ron -- come on back under the cloak -- Hermione panted
Dumbledore the Minister -- they 'll be coming back out in a minute -- But before they could cover themselves again , before they could even catch their breath , they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws
Something was bounding toward them , quiet as a shadow -- an enormous , pale-eyed , jet-black dog
Harry reached for his wand , but too late -- the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest ; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair ; he felt its hot breath , saw inch- long teeth -But the force of its leap had carried it too far ; it rolled off him
Dazed , feeling as though his ribs were broken , Harry tried to stand up ; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack
Ron was on his feet
As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry aside ; the dog 's jaws fastened instead around Ron 's outstretched arm
Harry lunged forward , he seized a handful of the brute 's hair , but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll -- Then , out of nowhere , something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again
He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too
Harry groped for his wand , blinking blood out of his eyesLumoshe whispered
The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree ; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind , whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer
And there , at the base of the trunk , was the dog , dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots -- Ron was fighting furiously , but his head and torso were slipping out of sight -- Ron Harry shouted , trying to follow , but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again
All they could see now was one of Ron 's legs , which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground -- but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot ; Ron 's leg had broken , and a moment later , his foot vanished from sight
Harry -- we 've got to go for help -- Hermione gasped ; she was bleeding too ; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder
No That thing 's big enough to eat him ; we have n't got time -- Harry -- we 're never going to get through without help -- Another branch whipped down at them , twigs clenched like knuckles
If that dog can get in , we can , Harry panted , darting here and there , trying to find a way through the vicious , swishing branches , but he could n't get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree 's blows
Oh , help , help , Hermione whispered frantically , dancing U
certainly on the spot , Please
Crookshanks darted forward
He slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk
Abruptly , as though the tree had been turned to marble , it stopped moving
Not a leaf twitched or shook
Crookshanks Hermione whispered uncertainly
She now grasped Harry 's arm painfully hard
How did he know -- ? He 's friends with that dog , said Harry grimly
I 've seen them together
Come on -- and keep your wand out -- They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds , but before they had reached the gap in the roots , Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail
Harry went next ; he crawled forward , headfirst , and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel
Crookshanks was a little way along , his eyes flashing in the light from Harry 's wand
Seconds later , Hermione slithered down beside him
Where 's Ron ? she whispered in a terrified voice
This way , said Harry , setting off , bent-backed , after Crookshanks
Where does this tunnel come out ? Hermione asked breathlessly from behind him
I do n't know
It 's marked on the Marauder 's Map but Fred and George said no one 's ever gotten into it
It goes off the edge of the map , but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade
They moved as fast as they could , bent almost double ; ahead of them , Crookshanks 's tail bobbed in and out of view
On and on went the passage ; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes
All Harry could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him
He was drawing breath in sharp , painful gasps , running at a crouch
And then the tunnel began to rise ; moments later it twisted , and Crookshanks had gone
instead , Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening
He and Hermione paused , gasping for breath , edging forward
Both raised their wands to see what lay beyond
It was a room , a very disordered , dusty room
Paper was peeling from the walls ; there were stains all over the floor ; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it
The windows were all boarded up
Harry glanced at Hermione , who looked very frightened but nodded
Harry pulled himself out of the hole , staring around
The room was deserted , but a door to their right stood open , leading to a shadowy hallway
Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry 's arm again
Her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows
Harry , she whispered , I think we 're in the Shrieking Shack
Harry looked around
His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them
Large chunks had been torn out of it ; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely
Ghosts did n't do that , he said slowly
At that moment , there was a creak overhead
Something had Moved upstairs
Both of them looked up at the ceiling
Hermione 's grip on Harry 's arm was so tight he was losing feeling in-his fingers
He raised his eyebrows at her ; she nodded again and let go
Quietly as they could , they crept out into the hall and UP the crumbling staircase
Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor , where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs
They reached the dark landing
Nox , they whispered together , and the lights at the end of their wands went out
Only one door was open
As they crept toward it , they heard movement from behind it ; a low moan , and then a deep , loud purring
They exchanged a last look , a last nod
Wand held tightly before him , Harry kicked the door wide open
On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks , purring loudly at the sight of them
On the floor beside him , clutching his leg , which stuck out at a strange angle , was Ron
Harry and Hermione dashed across to him
Ron -- are you okay ? Where 's the dog ? Not a dog , Ron moaned
His teeth were gritted with pain
Harry , it 's a trap -- What -- He 's the dog
he 's an Animagus
Ron was staring over Harry 's shoulder
Harry wheeled around
With a snap , the man in the shadows closed the door behind them
A mass of filthy , matted hair hung to his elbows
If eyes had n't been shining out of the deep , dark sockets , he might have been a corpse
The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face , it looked like a skull
His yellow teeth were bared in a grin
It was Sirius Black
Expelliarmushe croaked , pointing Ron 's wand at them
Harry 's and Hermione 's wands shot out of their hands , high in the air , and Black caught them
Then he took a step closer
His eyes were fixed on Harry
I thought you 'd come and help your friend , he said hoarsely
His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it
Your father would have done the same for me
Brave of you ) not to run for a teacher
it will make everything much easier
The taunt about his father rang in Harry 's ears as though Black had bellowed it
A boiling hate erupted in Harry 's chest , leaving no place for fear
For the first time in his life , he wanted his wand back in his hand , not to defend himself , but to attack
Without knowing what he was doing , he started forward , but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back
No , Harry Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper ; Ron , however , spoke to Black
If you want to kill Harry , you 'll have to kill us too he said fiercely , though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color , and he swayed slightly as he spoke
Something flickered in Black 's shadowed eyes
Lie down , he said quietly to Ron
You will damage that leg even more
Did you hear me ? Ron said weakly , though he was clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright
You 'll have to kill all three of usThere 'll be only one murder here tonight , said Brack , and his grin widened
Why 's that ? Harry spat , trying to wrench himself free of Ron , and Hermione
Did n't care last time , did you ? Did n't mind slaughtering all those Muggles to get at Pettigrew
What 's the matter , gone soft in Azkaban ? Harry Hermione whimpered
Be quietHE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD Harry roared , and with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione 's and Ron 's restraint and lunged forward -He had forgotten about magic -- he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen , whereas Black was a tall , full-grown man -- all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and that he did n't care how much he got hurt in return -- Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid , but Black did n't raise the wands in time -- one of Harry 's hands fastened over his wasted wrist , forcing the wand tips away ; the knuckles of Harry 's other hand collided with the side of Black 's head and they fell , backward , into the wall -Hermione was screaming ; Ron was yelling ; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black 's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry 's face by inches ; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly , but he clung on , his other hand punching every part of Black it could find
But Black 's free hand had found Harry 's throatNo , he hissed , I 've waited too long -- The fingers tightened , Harry choked , his glasses askew
Then he saw Hermione 's foot swing out of nowhere
Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain ; Ron had thrown himself on Black 's wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter -- He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor ; he threw himself toward it butArghCrookshanks had joined the fray ; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into Harry 's arm ; Harry threw him off , but Crookshanks now darted toward Harry 's wand -- NO YOU DO N'T roared Harry , and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside , spitting ; Harry snatched up his wand and turned -Get out of the way he shouted at Ron and Hermione
They did n't need telling twice
Hermione , gasping for breath , her lip bleeding , scrambled aside , snatching up her and Ron 's wands
Ron crawled to the four-poster and collapsed onto it , panting , his white face now tinged with green , both hands clutching his broken leg
Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall
His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer , his wand pointing straight at Black 's heart
Going to kill me , Harry ? he whispered
Harry stopped right above him , his wand still pointing at Black 's chest , looking down at him
A livid bruise was rising around Black 's left eye and his nose was bleeding
You killed my parents , said Harry , his voice shaking slightly , but his wand hand quite steady
Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes
I do n't deny it , he said very quietly
But if you knew the whole story
The whole story ? Harry repeated , a furious pounding in his ears
You sold them to Voldemort
That 's all I need to know
You 've got to listen to me , Black said , and there was a note of urgency in his voice now
You 'll regret it if you do n't
You do n't understand
I understand a lot better than you think , said Harry , and his voice shook more than ever
You never heard her , did you ? My mum
trying to stop Voldemort killing me
and you did that
you did it
Before either of them could say another word , something ginger streaked past Harry ; Crookshanks leapt onto Black 's chest and settled himself there , right over Black 's heart
Black blinked and looked down at the cat
Get off , he murmured , trying to push Crookshanks off him
But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black 's robes and would n't shift
He turned his ugly , squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes
To his right , Hermione gave a dry sob
Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks , his grip tightening on the wand
So what if he had to kill the cat too ? It was in league with Black
If it was prepared to die , trying to protect Black , that was n't Harry 's business
If Black wanted to save it , that only proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry 's parents
Harry raised the wand
Now was the moment to do it
Now was the moment to avenge his mother and father
He was going to kill Black
He had to kill Black
This was his chance
The seconds lengthened
And still Harry stood frozen there , wand poised , Black staring up at him , Crookshanks on his chest
Ron 's ragged breathing came from near the bed ; Hermione was quite silent
And then came a new sound -Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor -- someone was moving downstairs
WE 'RE UP HERE Hermione screamed suddenly
WE 'RE UP HERE -- SIRIUS BLACK - QUICKBlack made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks ; Harry gripped his wand convulsively -- Do it now said a voice in his head -- but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still had n't done it
The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room , his face bloodless , his wand raised and ready
His eyes flickered over Ron , lying on the floor , over Hermione , cowering next to the door , to Harry , standing there with his wand covering Black , and then to Black himself , crumpled and bleeding at Harry 's feet
Expelliarmus Lupin shouted
Harry 's wand flew once more out of his hand ; so did the two Hermione was holding
Lupin caught them all deftly , then moved into the room , staring at Black , who still had Crookshanks lying Protectively across his chest
Harry stood there , feeling suddenly empty
He had n't done it
His nerve had failed him
Black was going to be handed back to the dementors
Then Lupin spoke , in a very tense voice
Where is he , Sirius ? Harry looked quickly at Lupin
He did n't understannd what Lupin meant
Who was Lupin talking about ? He turned to look at Black again
Black 's face was quite expressionless
For a few seconds , he did n't move at all
Then , very slowly , he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron
Mystified , Harry glanced around at Ron , who looked bewildered
Lupin muttered , staring at Black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind ,
why has n't he shown himself before now ? Unless -- Lupin 's eyes suddenly widened , as though he was seeing something beyond Black , something none of the rest could see , -- unless he was the one
unless you switched
without telling me ? Very slowly , his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin 's face , Black nodded
Professor , Harry interrupted loudly , what 's going on -- ? But he never finished the question , because what he saw made his voice die in his throat
Lupin was lowering his wand , gazing fixed at Black
The Professor walked to Black 's side , seized his hand , pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor , and embraced Black like a brother
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach
DO N'T BELIEVE IT Hermione screamed
Lupin let go of Black and turned to her
She had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin , wild-eyed
You -- you -- Hermione -- -- you and himHermione , calm down -- I did n't tell anyone Hermione shrieked
I 've been covering up for you -- Hermione , listen to me , please ' Lupin shouted
I can explain -- Harry could feel himself shaking , not with fear , but with a fresh wave of fury
I trusted you , he shouted at Lupin , his voice wavering , out of control , and all the time you 've been his friendYou 're wrong , said Lupin
I have n't been Sirius 's friend , but I am now -- Let me explain
NO Hermione screamed
Harry , do n't trust him , he 's been helping Black get into the castle , he wants you dead too -- he 's a werewolfThere was a ringing silence
Everyone 's eyes were now on Lupin , who looked remarkably calm , though rather pale
Not at all up to your usual standard , Hermione , he said
Only one out of three , I 'm afraid
I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly do n't want Harry dead
An odd shiver passed over his face
But I wo n't deny that I am a werewolf
Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain
Lupin made toward him , looking concerned , but Ron gasped , Get away ftom me , werewolfLupin stopped dead
Then , with an obvious effort , he turned to Hermione and said , How long have you known ? Ages , Hermione whispered
Since I did Professor Snape 's essay
He 'll be delighted , said Lupin coolly
He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant
Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon ? Or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me ? Both , Hermione said quietly
Lupin forced a laugh
You 're the cleverest witch of your age I 've ever met , Hermione
I 'm not , Hermione whispered
If I 'd been a bit cleverer , I 'd have told everyone what you areBut they already know , said Lupin
At least , the staff do
Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf
Is he mad ? Some of the staff thought so , said Lupin
He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I 'm trustworthy -- AND HE WAS WRONG Harry yelled
YOUVE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME He was pointing at Black , who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed and sank onto it , his face hidden in one shaking hand
Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap , purring
Ron edged away from both of them , dragging his leg
I have not been helping Sirius , said Lupin
If you 'll give me a chance , I 'll explain
Look -- He separated Harry 's , Ron 's and Hermione 's wands and threw each back to its owner ; Harry caught his , stunned
There , said Lupin , sticking his own wand back into his belt You 're armed , we 're not
Now will you listen ? Harry did n't know what to think
Was it a trick ? If you have n't been helping him , he said , with a furious glance at Black , how did you know he was here ? The map , said Lupin
The Marauder 's Map
I was in my office examining it -- You know how to work it ? Harry said suspiciously
Of course I know how to work it , said Lupin , waving his hand impatiently
I helped write it
I 'm Moony -- that was my friends ' nickname for me at school
You wrote -- ? The important thing is , I was watching it carefully this evening , because I had an idea that you , Ron , and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed
And I was right , was n't IHe had started to pace up and down , looking at them
Little patches of dust rose at his feet
You might have been wearing your father 's old cloak , Harry -- How d'you know about the cloak ? The number of times I saw James disappearing under it
, said Lupin , waving an impatient hand again
The point is , even if you 're wearing an Invisibility Cloak , you still show up on the Marauder 's Map
I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid 's hut
Twenty minutes later , you left Hagrid , and set off back toward the castle
But you were now accompanied by somebody else
What ? said Harry
No , we weren'tI could n't believe my eyes , said Lupin , still pacing , and ignoring Harry 's interruption
I thought the map must be malfunctioning
How could he be with you ? No one was with us said Harry
And then I saw another dot , moving fast toward you , labeled Sirius Black
I saw him collide with you ; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow -- One of us Ron said angrily
No , Ron , said Lupin
Two of you
He had stopped his pacing , his eyes moving over Ron
Do you think I could have a look at the rat ? he said evenly
What ? said Ron
What 's Scabbers got to do with it ? Everything , said Lupin
Could I see him , please ? Ron hesitated , then put a hand inside his robes
Scabbers emerged , thrashing desperately ; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping
Crookshanks stood up on Black 's leg and made a soft hissing noise
Lupin moved closer to Ron
He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers
What ? Ron said again , holding Scabbers close to him , looking scared
What 's my rat got to do with anything ? That 's not a rat , croaked Sirius Black suddenly
What d'you mean -- of course he 's a rat -- No , he 's not , said Lupin quietly
He 's a wizard
An Animagus , said Black , by the name of Peter Pettigrew
CHAPTER EIGHTEENMOONY , WORMTAIL , PADDFOOT , AND PRONGSIt took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in
Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking
You 're both mental
Ridiculous said Hermione faintly
Peter Pettigrew 's dead said Harry
He killed him twelve years ago He pointed at Black , whose face twitched convulsively
I meant to , he growled , his yellow teeth bared , but little Peter got the better of me
not this time , thoughAnd Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers ; Ron yelled with pain as Black 's weight fell on his broken leg
Sirius , NO Lupin yelled , launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again , WAIT You ca n't do it just like that -- they need to understand -- we 've got to explain -- We can explain afterwards snarled Black , trying to throw Lupin off
One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers , who was squealing like a piglet , scratching Ron 's face and neck as he tried to escape
They 've -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything Lupin panted , still trying to restrain Black
Ron 's kept him as a pet There are parts of it even I do n't understand , and Harry -- you owe Harry the truth , SiriusBlack stopped struggling , though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers , who was clamped tightly under Ron 's bitten , scratched , ad bleeding hands
All right , then , Black said , without taking his eyes off the rat
Tell them whatever you like
But make it quick , Remus
I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for
You 're nutters , both of you , said Ron shakily , looking round at Harry and Hermione for support
I 've had enough of this
He tried to heave himself up on his good leg , but Lupin raised his wand again , pointing it at Scabbers
You 're going to hear me out , Ron , he said quietly
Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen
HE 'S NOT PETER , HE 'S SCABBERS Ron yelled , trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket , but Scabbers was fighting to hard ; Ron swayed and overbalanced , and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed
Then , ignoring Black , Harry turned to Lupin
There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die , he said
A whole street full of them
They did n't see what they thought they saw said Black savagely , still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron 's hands
Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter , said Lupin , nodding
I believed it myself -- until I saw the map tonight
Because the Marauder 's map never lies
Ron 's holding him , Harry
Harry looked down at Ron , and as their eyes met , they agreed , silently : Black and Lupin were both out of their minds
Their story made no sense whatsoever
How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew ? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him ? Then Hermione spoke , in a trembling , would-be calm sort of voice , as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly
But Professor Lupin
Scabbers ca n't be Pettigrew
it just ca n't be true , you know it ca n't
Why ca n't it be true ? Lupin said calmly , as though they were in class , and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows
because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus
We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall
And I looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals ; there 's a register showing what animal they become , and their markings and things
and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register , and there have been only seven Animagi this century , and Pettigrew 's name was n't on the list
Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework , when Lupin started to laugh
Light again , Hermione he said
But the Ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts
I you 're going to tell them the story , get a move on , Remus , said Black , who was still watching Scabbers 's every desperate move
I 've waited twelve years , I 'm not going to wait much longer
but you 'll need to help me , Sirius , said Lupin , I only know how it began
Lupin broke off
There had been a loud creak behind him
The bedroom door had opened of its own accord
All five of them stared at it
Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing
No one there
This place is haunted said Ron
It 's not , said Lupin , still looking at the door in a puzzled way
The Shrieking Shack was never haunted
The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me
He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes , thought for a moment then said , That 's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf , None of this could have happened if I had n't been bitter
and if I had n't been so foolhardy
He looked sober and tired
Ron started to interrupt , but Hermione , said , Shh She was watching Lupin very intently
I as a very small boy when I received the bite
My parents tried everything , but in those days there was no cure
The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery
It makes me safe , you see
As long as I take it in the week , preceding the full moon , I keep my mind when I transform
I 'm able to curl up in my office , a harmless wolf , and wait for the moon to wane again
Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered , however , I became a fully fledged monster once a month
It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts
Other parents were n't likely to want their children exposed to me
But then Dumbledore became Headmaster , and he was sympathetic
He said that as long as we took certain precautions , there was no reason I should n't come to school
Lupin sighed , and looked directly at Harry
I told you , months ago , that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts
The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts
This house -- Lupin looked miserably around the room , -- the tunnel that leads to it -- they were built for my use
Once a month , I was smuggled out of the castle , into this place , to transform
The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous
Harry could n't see where this story was going , but he was listening raptly all the same
The only sound apart from Lupin 's voice was Scabbers 's frightened squeaking
My transformations in those days were -- were terrible
It is very painful to turn into a werewolf
I was separated from humans to bite , so I bit and scratched myself instead
The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits
Dumbledore encouraged the rumor
Even now , when the house has been silent for years , the villagers do n't dare approach it
But apart from my transformations , I was happier than I had ever been in my life
For the first time ever , I had friends , three great friends
and , of course , your father , Harry -- James Potter
Now , my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month
I made up all sorts of stories
I told them my mother was ill , and that I had to go home to see her
I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was
But of course , they , like you , Hermione , worked out the truth
And they did n't desert me at all
Instead , they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable , but the best times of my life
They became Animagi
My dad too ? said Harry , astounded
Yes , indeed , said Lupin
It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it
Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school , and lucky they were , because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it
Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius
Finally , in our fifth year , they managed it
They could each turn into a different animal at will
But how did that help you ? said Hermione , sounding puzzled
They could n't keep me company as humans , so they kept me company as animals , said Lupin
A werewolf is only a danger to people
They sneaked out of the castle every month under James 's Invisibility Cloak
Peter , as the smallest , could slip beneath the Willow 's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it
They would then slip down the tunnel and join me
Under their influence , I became less dangerous
My body was still wolfish , but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them
Hurry up , Remus , snarled Black , who was still watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face
I 'm getting there , Sirius , I 'm getting there
well , highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform
Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night
Sirius and James transformed into such large animals , they were able to keep a werewolf in check
I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did
And that 's how we came to write the Marauder 's Map , and sign it with our nicknames
Sirius is Padfoot
Peter is Wormtail
James was Prongs
What sort of animal -- ? Harry began , but Hermione cut him off
That was still really dangerous Running around in the dark with a werewolf What if you 'd given the others the slip , and bitten somebody ? A thought that still haunts me , said Lupin heavily
And there were near misses , many of them
We laughed about them afterwards
We were young , thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness
I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore 's trust , of course
he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so , and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others ' safety
He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally
But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month 's adventure
And I have n't changed
Lupin 's face had hardened , and there was self-disgust in his voice
All this year , I have been battling with myself , wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus
But I did n't do it
Why ? Because I was too cowardly
It would have meant admitting that I 'd betrayed his trust while I was at school , admitting that I 'd led others along with me
and Dumbledore 's trust has meant everything to me
He let me into Hogwarts as a boy , and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life , unable to find paid work because of what I am
And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort , that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it
so , in a way , Snape 's been right about me all along
Snape ? said Black harshly , taking his eyes off Scabbers ; for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin
What 's Snape got to do with it ? He 's here , Sirius , said Lupin heavily
He 's teaching here as well
He looked up at Harry , Ron , and Hermione
Professor Snape was at school with us
He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job
He has been telling Dumbledore A year that I am not to be trusted
He has his reasons
you see , Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him , a trick which involved me -- Black made a derisive noise
It served him right , he sneered
Sneaking around , trying to find out what we were up to
hoping he could get us expelled
Severus was very interested in where I went every month
Lupin told Harry , Ron , and Hermione
We were in the same year , you know , and we -- er -- did n't like each other very much
He especially disliked James
Jealous , I think , of James 's talent on the Quidditch field
anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform
Sirius thought it would be -- er -- amusing , to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick , and he 'd be able to get in after me
Well , of course , Snape tried it -- if he 'd got as far as this house , he 'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father , who 'd heard what Sirius had done , went after Snape and pulled him back , at great risk to his life
Snape glimpsed me , though , at the end of the tunnel
He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody , but from that time on he knew what I was
So that 's why Snape does n't like you , said Harry slowly , because he thought you were in on the joke ? That 's right , sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin
Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak , his wand pointing , directly at Lupin
CHAPTER NINETEENTHE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORTHermione screamed
Black leapt to his feet
Harry felt as though he 'd received a huge electric shock
I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow , said Snape , throwing the cloak aside , careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin 's chest
Very useful , Potter , I thank you
Snape was slightly breathless , but his face was full of suppressed triumph
You 're wondering , perhaps , how I knew you were here ? he said , his eyes glittering
I 've just been to your office , Lupin
You forgot to take your potion tonight , so I took a gobletful along
And very lucky I did
lucky for me , I mean
Lying on your desk was a certain map
One glance at it told me all I needed to know
I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight
Severus -- Lupin began , but Snape overrode him
I 've told the headmaster again and again that you 're helping your old friend Black into the castle , Lupin , and here 's the proof
Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout -- Severus , you 're making a mistake , said Lupin urgently
You have n't heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry -- Two more for Azkaban tonight , said Snape , his eyes now gleaming fanatically
I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this
He was quite convinced you were harmless , you know , Lupin
a tame werewolf -- You fool , said Lupin softly
Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban ? BANG Thin , snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape 's wand and twisted themselves around Lupin 's mouth , wrists , and ankles ; he overbalanced and fell to the floor , unable to move
With a roar of rage , Black started toward Snape , but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black 's eyes
Give me a reason , he whispered
Give me a reason to do it , and I swear I will
Black stopped dead
It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred
Harry stood there , paralyzed , not knowing what to do or whom to believe
He glanced around at Ron and Hermione
Ron looked just as confused as he did , still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers
Hermione , however , took an uncertain step toward Snape and said , in a very breathless voice , Professor Snape -- it it would n't hurt to hear what they 've got to say , w -- would it ? Miss Granger , you are already facing suspension from this school , Snape spat
You , Potter , and Weasley are out-of-bounds , in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf
For once in your life , hold your tongue
But if -- if there was a mistake -- KEEP QUIET , YOU STUPID GIRL Snape shouted , looking suddenly quite deranged
DO N'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DO N'T UNDERSTAND A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand , which was still pointed at Black 's face
Hermione fell silent
Vengeance is very sweet , Snape breathed at Black
How I hoped I would be the one to catch you
The joke 's on you again , Severus , Black snarled
As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle -- he jerked his head at Ron -- I 'll come quietly
Up to the castle ? said Snape silkily
I do n't think we need to go that far
All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow
They 'll be very pleased to see you , Black
pleased enough to give you a little kiss , I daresay
I -- What little color there was in Blacks face left it
You -you 've got to hear me out , he croaked
The rat -- look at the rat -- But there was a mad glint in Snape 's eyes that Harry had never seen before
He seemed beyond reason
Come on , all of you , he said
He clicked his fingers , and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands
I 'll drag the werewolf
Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too -- Before he knew what he was doing , Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door
Get out of the way , Potter , you 're in enough trouble already , snarled Snape
If I had n't been here to save your skin -- Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year , Harry said
I 've been alone with him loads of times , having defense lessons against the dementors
If he was helping Black , why did n't he just finish me off then ? Do n't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf 's mind works , hissed Snape
Get out of the way , Potter
YOURE PATHETIC Harry yelled
JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WO N'T EVEN LISTEN -- SILENCE I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT Snape shrieked , looking madder than ever
Like father , like son , Potter I have just saved your neck ; you should be thanking me on bended knee You would have been well served if he 'd killed you You 'd have died like your father , too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the way , or I will make you
GET OUT OF THE WAY , POTTERHarry made up his mind in a split second
Before Snape could take even one step toward him , he had raised his wand
Expelliarmus he yelled -- except that his was n't the only voice that shouted
There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges ; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall , then slid down it to the floor , a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair
He had been knocked out
Harry looked around
Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment
Snape 's wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks
You should n't have done that , said Black , looking at Harry
You should have left him to me
Harry avoided Black 's eyes
He was n't sure , even now , that he 'd done the right thing
We attacked a teacher
We attacked a teacher
Hermione whimpered , staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes
Oh , we 're going to be in so much trouble -- Lupin was struggling against his bonds
Black bent down quickly and untied him
Lupin straightened up , rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them
Thank you , Harry , he said
I 'm still not saying I believe you , he told Lupin
Then it 's time we offered you some proof , said Lupin
You , boy -- give me Peter , please
Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest
Come off it , he said weakly
Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers ? I mean
He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support , Okay , say Pettigrew could turn into a rat -- there are millions of rats -- how 's he supposed to know which one he 's after if he was locked up in Azkaban ? You know , Sirius , that 's a fair question , said Lupin , turning to Black and frowning slightly
How did you find out where he was ? Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper , which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others
It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer , and there , on Ron 's shoulder , was Scabbers
How did you get this ? Lupin asked Black , thunderstruck
Fudge , said Black
When he came to inspect Azkaban last year , he gave me his paper
And there was Peter , on the front page on this boy 's shoulder
I knew him at once
how many times had I seen him transform ? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts
to where Harry was
My God , said Lupin softly , staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again
His front paw
What about it ? said Ron defiantly
He 's got a toe missing , said Black
Of course , Lupin breathed
he cut it off himself ? Just before he transformed , said Black
When I cornered him , he yelled for the whole street to hear that I 'd betrayed Lily and James
Then , before I could curse him , he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back , killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and sped down into the sewer with the other rats
Did n't you ever hear , Ron ? said Lupin
The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger
Look , Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something He 's been in my family for ages , right -- Twelve years , in fact , said Lupin
Did n't you ever wonder why he was living so long ? We -- we 've been taking good care of him said Ron
Not looking too good at the moment , though , is he ? said Lupin
I 'd guess he 's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again
He 's been scared of that mad cat said Ron , nodding toward Crookshanks , who was still purring on the bed
But that was n't right , Harry thought suddenly
Scabbers had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks
ever since Ron 's return from Egypt
since the time when Black had escaped
This cat is n't mad , said Black hoarsely
He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks 's fluffy head
He 's the most intelligent of his kind I 've ever met
He recognized Peter for what he was right away
And when he met me , he knew I was no dog
It was a while before he trusted me
Finally , I managed to communicate to him what I was after , and he 's been helping me
What do you mean ? breathed Hermione
He tried to bring Peter to me , but could n't
so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me
As I understand it , he took them from a boy 's bedside table
Harry 's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing
It was absurd
But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it
This cat -- Crookshanks , did you call him ? -- told me Peter had left blood on the sheets
I supposed he bit himself
Well , faking his own death had worked once
These words jolted Harry to his senses
And why did he fake his death ? he said furiously
Because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parentsNo , said Lupin , Harry-And now you 've come to finish him offYes , I have , said Black , with an evil look at Scabbers
Then I should 've let Snape take you Harry shouted
Harry , said Lupin hurriedly , do n't you see ? All this time we 've thought Sirius betrayed your parents , and Peter tracked him down -- but it was the other way around , do n't you see ? Peter betrayed your mother and father -- Sirius tracked Peter down -- THAT 'S NOT TRUE Harry yelled
HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP
HE SAID HE KILLED THEMHe was pointing at Black , who shook his head slowly ; the sunken eyes were suddenly over bright
I as good as killed them , he croaked
I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment , persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me
I 'm to blame , I know it
The night they died , I 'd arranged to check on Peter , make sure he was still safe , but when I arrived at his hiding place , he 'd gone
Yet there was no sign of a struggle
It did n't feel right
I was scared
I set out for your parents ' house straight away
And when I saw their house , destroyed , and their bodies
I realized what Peter must 've done
what I 'd done
His voice broke
He turned away
Enough of this , said Lupin , and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before
There 's one certain way to prove what really happened
Ron , give me that rat
What are you going to do with him if I give him to you ? Ron asked Lupin tensely
Force him to show himself , said Lupin
If he really is a rat , it wo n't hurt him
Then at long last , he held out Scabbers and Lupin took him
Scabbers began to squeak without stopping , twisting and turning , his tiny black eyes bulging in his head
Ready , Sirius ? said Lupin
Black had already retrieved Snape 's wand from the bed
He approached Lupin and the struggling rat , and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face
Together ? he said quietly
I think so , , , said Lupin , holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other
On the count of three
One -- two -- THREEA flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands ; for a moment , Scabbers was frozen in midair , his small gray form twisting madly -- Ron yelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor
There was another blinding flash of light and then -- It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree
A head was shooting upward from the ground ; limbs were sprouting ; a moment later , a man was standing where Scabbers had been , cringing and wringing his hands
Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed ; the hair on his back was standing up
He was a very short man , hardly taller than Harry and Hermione
His thin , colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top
He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time
His skin looked grubby , almost like Scabbers 's fur , and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small , watery eyes
He looked around at them all , his breathing fast and shallow
Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again
Well , hello , Peter , said Lupin pleasantly , as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him
Long time , no see
S -- Sirius
R -- Remus
Even Pettigrew 's voice was squeaky
Again , his eyes darted toward the door
my old friends
Black 's wand arm rose , but Lupin seized him around the wrist , gave him a warning took , then turned again to Pettigrew , his voice light and casual
We 've been having a little chat , Peter , about what happened the night Lily and James died
You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed -- Remus , gasped Pettigrew , and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face , you do n't believe him , do you
? He tried to kill me , Remus
So we 've heard , said Lupin , more coldly
I 'd like to clear up one or two little matters with you , Peter , if you 'll be so -- He 's come to try and kill me again Pettigrew squeaked suddenly , pointing at Black , and Harry saw that he used his middle finger , because his index was missing
He killed Lily and James and now he 's going to kill me too
You 've got to help me , Remus
Black 's face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes
No one 's going to try and kill you until we 've sorted a few things out , said Lupin
Sorted things out ? squealed Pettigrew , looking wildly about him once more , eyes taking in the boarded windows and , again ' the only door
I knew he 'd come after me I knew he 'd be back for me I 've been waiting for this for twelve yearsYou knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban ? said Lupin , his brow furrowed
When nobody has ever done it before ? He 's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of Pettigrew shouted shrilly
How else did he get out of there ? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricksBlack started to laugh , a horrible , mirthless laugh that filled the whole room
Voldemort , teach me tricks ? he said
Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him
What , scared to hear your old master 's name ? said Black
I do n't blame you , Peter
His lot are n't very happy with you , are they ? Do n't know what you mean , Sirius -- muttered Pettigrew , his breathing faster than ever
His whole face was shining with sweat now
You have n't been hiding from me for twelve years , said Black
You 've been hiding from Voldemort 's old supporters
I heard things in Azkaban , Peter
They all think you 're dead , or you 'd have to answer to them
I 've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep
Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them
Voldemort went to the Potters ' on your information
and Voldemort met his downfall there
And not all Voldemort 's supporters ended up in Azkaban , did they ? There are still plenty out here , biding their time , pretending they 've seen the error of their ways
If they ever got wind that you were still alive , Peter -- Do n't know
what you 're talking about
, said Pettigrew again , more shrilly than ever
He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin
You do n't believe this -- this madness , Remus -- I must admit , Peter , I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat , said Lupin evenly
Innocent , but scared squealed Pettigrew
If Voldemort 's supporters were after me , it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban -- the spy , Sirius BlackBlack 's face contorted
How dare you , he growled , sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been
I , a spy for Voldemort ? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself ? But you , Peter -- I 'll never understand why I did n't see you were the spy from the start
You always liked big friends who 'd look after you , did n't you ? It used to be us
me and Remus
Pettigrew wiped his face again ; he was almost panting for breath
Me , a spy
must be out of your mind
do n't know how you can say such a -- Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it , Black hissed , so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward
I thought it was the perfect plan
Voldemort would be sure to come after me , would never dream they 'd use a weak , talentless thing like you
It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life , telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters
Pettigrew was muttering distractedly ; Harry caught words like far-fetched and lunacy , but he could n't help paying more attention to the ashen color of Pettigrew 's face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door
Professor Lupin ? said Hermione timidly
Can -- can I say something ? Certainly , Hermione , said Lupin courteously
Well -- Scabbers -- I mean , this -- this man -- he 's been sleeping in Harry 's dormitory for three years
If he 's working for You-Know-Who , how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now ? There said Pettigrew shrilly , pointing at Ron with his maimed hand
Thank you You see , Remus ? I have never hurt a hair of Harry 's head Why should I ? I 'll tell you why , said Black
Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you
Voldemort 's been in hiding for fifteen years , they say he 's half dead
You were n't about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore 's nose , for a wreck of a wizard who 'd lost all of his power , were you ? You 'd want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him , would n't you ? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in ? Keeping an ear out for news , were n't YOU , Peter ? Just in case your old protector regained strength , and it was safe to rejoin him
Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times
He seemed to have lost the ability to talk
Er -- Mr
Black -- Sirius ? said Hermione
Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her
If you do n't mind me asking , how -- how did you get out of Azkaban , if you did n't use Dark Magic ? Thank you gasped Pettigrew , nodding frantically at her
Exactly Precisely what I -- But Lupin silenced him with a look
Black was frowning slightly at Hermione , but not as though he were annoyed with her
He seemed to be pondering his answer
I do n't know how I did it , he said slowly
I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent
That was n't a happy thought , so the dementors could n't suck it out of me
but it kept me sane and knowing who I am
helped me keep my powers
so when it all became
I could transform in my cell
become a dog
Dementors ca n't see , you know
They feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions
They could tell that my feelings were less -- less human , less complex when I was a dog
but they thought , of course , that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there , so it did n't trouble them
But I was weak , very weak , and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand
But then I saw Peter in that picture
I realized he was at Hogwarts with Harry
perfectly positioned to act , if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again
Pettigrew was shaking his head , mouthing noiselessly , but staring all the while at Black as though hypnotized
ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies
and to deliver the last Potter to them
if he gave them Harry , who 'd dare say he 'd betrayed Lord Voldemort ? He 'd be welcomed back with honors
So you see , I had to do something
I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive
Harry remembered what Mr
Weasley had told Mrs
The guards say he 's been talking in his sleep
always the same words
He 's at Hogwarts
It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head , and the dementors could n't destroy it
It was n't a happy feeling
it was an obsession
but it gave me strength , it cleared my mind
So , one night when they opened my door to bring food , I slipped past them as a dog
It 's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused
I was thin , very thin
thin enough to slip through the bars
I swam as a dog back to the mainland
I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog
I 've been living in the forest ever since , except when I came to watch the Quidditch , of course
You fly as well as your father did , Harry
He looked at Harry , who did not look away
Believe me , croaked Black
Believe me , Harry
I never betrayed James and Lily
I would have died before I betrayed them
And at long last , Harry believed him
Throat too tight to speak , he nodded
NoPettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry 's nod had been his own death sentence
He shuffled forward on his knees , groveling , his hands clasped in front of him as though praying
Sirius -- it 's me
you would n't -- Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled
There 's enough filth on my robes without you touching them , said Black
Remus Pettigrew squeaked , turning to Lupin instead , writhing imploringly in front of him
You do n't believe this would n't Sirius have told you they 'd changed the plan ? Not if he thought I was the spy , Peter , said Lupin
I assume that 's why you did n't tell me , Sirius ? he said casually over Pettigrews head
Forgive me , Remus , said Black
Not at all , Padfoot , old friend , said Lupin , who was now rolling up his sleeves
And will you , in turn , forgive me for believing you were the spy ? Of course , said Black , and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face
He , too , began rolling up his sleeves
Shall we kill him together ? Yes , I think so , said Lupin grimly
, gasped Pettigrew
And he scrambled around to Ron
have n't I been a good friend
a good pet ? You wo n't let them kill me , Ron , will you
you 're on my side , are n't you
But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion
I let you sleep in my bed he said
Pettigrew crawled toward Ron You wo n't let them do it
I was your rat
I was a good pet
If you made a better rat than a human , it 's not much to boast about , Peter , said Black harshly
Ron , going still paler with pain , wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew 's reach
Pettigrew turned on his knees , staggered forward , and seized the hem of Hermione 's robes
you -- you wo n't let them
Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew 's clutching hands and backed away against the wall , looking horrified
Pettigrew knelt , trembling uncontrollably , and-turned his head slowly toward Harry
you look just like your father
just like him
HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY ? roared Black
HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM ? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM ? Harry , whispered Pettigrew , shuffling toward him , hands outstretched
Harry , James would n't have wanted me killed
James would have understood , Harry
he would have shown me mercy
Both Black and Lupin strode forward , seized Pettigrew 's shoulders , and threw him backward onto the floor
He sat there , twitching with terror , staring up at them
You sold Lily and James to Voldemort , said Black , who was shaking too
Do you deny it ? Pettigrew burst into tears
It was horrible to watch , like an oversized , balding baby , cowering on the floor
Sirius , Sirius , what could I have done ? The Dark Lord
you have no idea
he has weapons you ca n't imagine
I was scared , Sirius , I was never brave like you and Remus and James
I never meant it to happen
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me -- DO N'T LIE bellowed Black
YOU 'D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED YOU WERE HIS SPYHe -- he was taking over everywhere gasped Pettigrew
Wh -- what was there to be gained by refusing him ? What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed ? said Black , with a terrible fury in his face
Only innocent lives , PeterYou do n't understand whined Pettigrew
He would have killed me , SiriusTHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED roared Black
DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS , AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOUBlack and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder , wands raised
You should have realized , said Lupin quietly , if Voldemort did n't kill you , we would
Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall
NO Harry yelled
He ran forward , placing himself in front Pettigrew , facing the wands
You ca n't kill him , he said breathlessly
Black and Lupin both looked staggered
Harry , this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents , Black snarled
This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too , without turning a hair
You heard him
His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family
I know , Harry panted
We 'll take him up to the castle
We 'll hand him over to the dementors
He can go to Azkaban
but do n't kill him
Harry gasped Pettigrew , and he flung his arms around Harry 's knees
You -- thank you -- it 's more than I deserve -- thank you -- Get off me , Harry spat , throwing Pettigrew 's hands off him in disgust
I 'm not doing this for you
I 'm doing it because -- I do n't reckon my dad would 've wanted them to become killers -- just for you
No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew , whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest
Black and Lupin were looking at each other
Then , with one movement , they lowered their wands
You 're the only person who has the right to decide , Harry , said Black
think what he did
He can go to Azkaban , Harry repeated
If anyone deserves that place , he does
Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him
Very well , said Lupin
Stand aside , Harry
I 'm going to tie him up , said Lupin
That 's all , I swear
Harry stepped out of the way
Thin cords shot from Lupin 's wand this time , and next moment , Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor , bound and gagged
But if you transform , Peter , growled Black , his own wand pointing at Pettigrew too , we will kill you
You agree , Harry ? Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him
Right , said Lupin , suddenly businesslike
Ron , I ca n't mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey , so I think it 's best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing
He hurried over to Ron , bent down , tapped Ron 's leg with his wand , and muttered , Ferula
Bandages spun up Ron 's leg , strapping it tightly to a splint
Lupin helped him to his feet ; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and did n't wince
That 's better , he said
What about Professor Snape ? said Hermione in a small voice , looking down at Snape 's prone figure
There 's nothing seriously wrong with him , said Lupin , bending over Snape and checking his pulse
You were just a little -- overenthusiastic
Still out cold
Er -- perhaps it will be best if we do n't revive him until we 're safety back in the castle
We can take him like this
He muttered , Mobilicorpus
As though invisible strings were tied to Snape 's wrists , neck , and knees , he was pulled into a standing position , head still lolling unpleasantly , like a grotesque puppet
He hung a few inches above the ground , his limp feet dangling
Lupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket
And two of us should be chained to this , said Black , nudging Pettigrew with his toe
Just to make sure
I 'll do it , said Lupin
And me , said Ron savagely , limping forward
Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air ; soon Pettigrew was upright again , left arm chained to Lupin 's right , right arm to Ron 's left
Ron 's face was set
He seemed to have taken Scabbers 's true identity as a personal insult
Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room , his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high
CHAPTER TWENTYTHE DEMENTOR 'S KISSHarry had never been part of a stranger group
Crookshanks led the way down the stairs ; Lupin , Pettigrew , and Ron went next , looking like entrants in a six-legged race
Next came Professor Snape , drifting creepily along , his toes hitting each stair as they descended , held up by his own wand , which was being pointed at him by Sirius
Harry and Hermione brought up the rear
Getting back into the tunnel was difficult
Lupin , Pettigrew , and Ron had to turn sideways to manage it ; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered with his wand
Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file
Crookshanks was still in the lead
Harry went right after Black , who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them ; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling
Harry had the impression Black was making no effort to prevent this
You know what this means ? Black said abruptly to Harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel
Turning Pettigrew in ? You ' re free , said Harry
, said Black
But I 'm also -- I do n't know if anyone ever told you -- I 'm your godfather
Yeah , I knew that , said Harry
your parents appointed me your guardian , said Black stiffly
If anything happened to them
Did Black mean what he thought he meant ? I 'll understand , of course , if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle , said Black
think about it
Once my name 's cleared
if you wanted a
a different home
Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry 's stomach
What -- live with you ? he said , accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling
Leave the Dursleys ? Of course , I thought you would n't want to , said Black quickly
I understand , I just thought I 'd -- Are you insane ? said Harry , his voice easily as croaky as Black 's
Of course I want to leave the Dursleys Have you got a house ? When can I move in ? Black turned right around to look at him ; Snape 's head was scraping the ceiling but Black did n't seem to care
You want to ? he said
You mean it ? Yeah , I mean it said Harry
Black 's gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon it
The difference it made was startling , as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask ; for a moment , he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry 's parents ' wedding
They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel
Crookshanks darted up first ; he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk , because Lupin , Pettigrew , and Ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches
Black saw Snape up through the hole , then stood back for Harry and Hermione to pass
At last , all of them were out
The grounds were very dark now ; the only light came from the distant windows of the castle
Without a word , they set off
Pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering
Harry 's mind was buzzing
He was going to leave the Dursleys
He was going to live with Sirius Black , his parents ' best friend
He felt dazed
What would happen when he told the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they 'd seen on television
One wrong move , Peter , said Lupin threateningly ahead
His wand was still pointed sideways at Pettigrew 's chest
Silently they tramped through the grounds , the castle lights growing slowly larger
Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black , his chin bumping on his chest
And then -A cloud shifted
There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground
Their party was bathed in moonlight
Snape collided with Lupin , Pettigrew , and Ron , who had stopped abruptly
He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop
Harry could see Lupin 's silhouette
He had gone rigid
Then his limbs began to shake
Oh , my -- Hermione gasped
He did n't take his potion tonight He 's not safeRun , Black whispered
But Harry could n't run
Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin
He leapt forward but Black caught him around the chest and threw him back
Leave it to me -- RUNThere was a terrible snarling noise
Lupin 's head was lengthening
So was his body
His shoulders were hunching
Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands , which were curling into clawed paws
Crookshanks 's hair was on end again ; he was backing away -- As the werewolf reared , snapping its long jaws , Sirius disappeared from Harry 's side
He had transformed
The enormous , bearlike dog bounded forward
As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it , the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward , away from Ron and Pettigrew
They were locked , jaw to jaw , claws ripping at each other
Harry stood , transfixed by the sight , too intent upon the battle to notice anything else
It was Hermione 's scream that alerted him -- Pettigrew had dived for Lupin 's dropped wand
Ron , unsteady on his bandaged leg , fell
There was a bang , a burst of light -- and Ron lay motionless on the ground
Another bang -- Crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap
Harry yelled , pointing his own wand at Pettigrew ; Lupin 's wand flew high into the air and out of sight
Stay where you are Harry shouted , running forward
Pettigrew had transformed
Harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron 's outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass
There was a howl and a rumbling growl ; Harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight ; it was galloping into the forest -- Sirius , he 's gone , Pettigrew transformed Harry yelled
Black was bleeding ; there were gashes across his muzzle and back , but at Harry 's words he scrambled up again , and in an instant , the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds
Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron
What did he do to him ? Hermione whispered
Ron 's eyes were only half-closed , his mouth hung open ; he was definitely alive , they could hear him breathing , but he did n't seem to recognize them
I do n't know
Harry looked desperately around
Black and Lupin both gone
they had no one but Snape for company , still hanging , unconscious , in midair
We 'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone , said Harry , pushing his hair out of his eyes , trying to think straight
Come -- But then , from beyond the range of their vision , they heard a yelping , a whining : a dog in pain
Sirius , Harry muttered , staring into the darkness
He had a moment 's indecision , but there was nothing they could do for Ron at the moment , and by the sound of it , Black was in trouble -- Harry set off at a run , Hermione right behind him
The yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake
They pelted toward it , and Harry , running flat out , felt the cold without realizing what it must mean -The yelping stopped abruptly
As they reached the lakeshore , they saw why -- Sirius had turned back into a man
He was crouched on all fours , his hands over his head
'Nooo , he moaned
And then Harry saw them
Dementors , at least a hundred of them , gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them
He spun around , the familiar , icy cold penetrating his insides , fog starting to obscure his vision ; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side ; they were encircling them
Herrnione , think of something happy Harry yelled , raising his wand , blinking furiously to try and clear his vision , shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it -- I 'm going to live with my godfather
I 'm leaving the Dursleys
He forced himself to think of Black , and only Black , and began to chant : Expecto patronum Expecto patronumBlack gave a shudder , rolled over , and lay motionless on the ground , pale as death
He 'll be all right
I 'm going to go and live with him
Expecto patronum Hermione , help me Expecto patronumExpecto -- Hermione whispered , expecto -- expecto -- But she could n't do it
The dementors were closing in , barely ten feet from them
They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione , and were getting closer
EXPECTO PATRONUM Harry yelled , trying to blot the screaming from his ears
EXPECTO PATRONUMA thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him
At the same moment , Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him
He was alone
Expecto -- expecto patronum -- Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass
Fog was clouding his eyes
With a huge effort , he fought to remember -- Sirius was innocent -- innocent -- We 'll be okay -- I ' mgoing to live with him -- Ex ecto patronum he gasped
By the feeble light of his formless Patronus , He saw a dementor halt , very close to him
It could n't walk through the cloud of silver mist Harry had conjured
A dead , slimy hand slid out from under the cloak
It made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside
No -- no -- Harry gasped
expecto expecto patronum -- He could feet them watching him , hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him
The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him
Then it raised both its rotting hands -- and lowered its hood
Where there should have been eyes , there was only thin , gray scabbed skin , stretched blankly over empty sockets
But there was a mouth
a gaping , shapeless hole , sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle
A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he could n't move or speak
His Patronus flickered and died
White fog was blinding him
He had to fight
he could n't see
and in the distance , he heard the familiar screaming
he groped in the mist for Sirius , and found his arm
they were n't going to take him
But a pair of strong , clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around Harry 's neck
They were forcing his face upward
He could feel its breath
It was going to get rid of him first
He could feel its putrid breath
His mother was screaming in his ears
She was going to be the last thing he ever heard -- And then , through the fog that was drowning him , he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter
He felt himself fall forward onto the grass
Facedown , too weak to move , sick and shaking , Harry opened his eyes
The dementor must have released him
The blinding light was illuminating the grass around him
The screaming had stopped , the cold was ebbing away
Something was driving the dementors back
It was circling around him and Black and Hermione
They were leaving
The air was warm again
With every ounce of strength he could muster , Harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light , galloping away across the lake
Eyes blurred with sweat , Harry tried to make out what it was
It was as bright as a unicorn
Fighting to stay conscious , Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore
For a moment , Harry saw , by its brightness , somebody welcoming it back
raising his hand to pat it
someone who looked strangely familiar
but it could n't be
Harry did n't understand
He could n't think anymore
He felt the last of his strength leave him , and his head hit the ground as he fainted
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEHERMIONE 'S SECRETShocking business
miracle none of them died
never heard the like
by thunder , it was lucky you were there , Snape
Thank you , Minister
Order of Merlin , Second Class , I 'd say
First Class , if I can wangle itThank you very much indeed , Minister
Nasty cut you 've got there
Black 's work , I suppose ? As a matter of fact , it was Potter , Weasley , and Granger , Minister
NoBlack had bewitched them , I saw it immediately
A Confundus Charm , to judge by their behavior
They seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent
They were n't responsible for their actions
On the other hand , their interference might have permitted Black to escape
They obviously thought they were going to catch Black single-handed
They 've got away with a great deal before now
I 'm afraid it 's given them a rather high opinion of themselves
and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster -- Ah , well , Snape
Harry Potter , you know
we 've all got a bit of a blind spot where he 's concerned
And yet -- is it good for him to be given so much special treatment ? Personally , I try and treat him like any other student
And any other student would be suspended -- at the very least -- for leading his friends into such danger
Consider , Minister -- against all school rules -- after all the precautions put in place for his protection -- out-of-bounds , at night , consorting with a werewolf and a murderer -- and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too -- Well , well
we shall see , Snape , we shall see
The boy has undoubtedly been foolish
Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut
He felt very groggy
The words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain , so that it was difficult to understand
His limbs felt like lead ; his eyelids too heavy to lift
He wanted to lie here , on this comfortable bed , forever
What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors
you 've really no idea what made them retreat , Snape ? No , Minister
by the time I had come 'round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances
And yet Black , and Harry , and the girl -- All unconscious by the time I reached them
I bound and gagged Black , naturally , conjured stretchers , and brought them all straight back to the castle
There was a pause
Harry 's brain seemed to be moving a little faster , and as it did , a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach
He opened his eyes
Everything was slightly blurred
Somebody had removed his glasses
He was lying in the dark hospital wing
At the very end of the ward , he could make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him , bending over a bed
Ron 's red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey 's arm
Harry moved his head over on the pillow
In the bed to his right lay Hermione
Moonlight was falling across her bed
Her eyes were open too
She looked petrified , and when she saw that Harry was awake , pressed a finger to her lips , then pointed to the hospital wing door
It was ajar , and the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from the corridor outside
Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry 's bed
He turned to took at her
She was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life
It looked like a small boulder
Ah , you 're awake she said briskly
She placed the chocolate on Harry 's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer
How 's Ron ? said Harry and Hermione together
He 'll live , said Madam Pomfrey grimly
As for you two you 'll be staying here until I 'm satisfied you 're -- Potter , what do you think you 're doing ? Harry was sitting up , putting his glasses back on , and picking up his wand
I need to see the headmaster , he said
Potter , said Madam Pomfrey soothingly , it 's all right
They 've got Black
He 's locked away upstairs
The dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now -- WHAT ? Harry jumped up out of bed ; Hermione had done the same
But his shout had been heard in the corridor outside ; next second , Cornelius Fudge and Snape had entered the ward
Harry , Harry , what 's this ? said Fudge , looking agitated
You should be in bed -- has he had any chocolate ? he asked Madam Pomfrey anxiously
Minister , listen Harry said
Sirius Black 's innocent Peter Pettigrew faked his own death We saw him tonight You ca n't let the dementors do that thing to Sirius , he 's -- But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face
Harry , Harry , you 're very confused , you 've been through a dreadful ordeal , lie back down , now , we 've got everything under control
YOU HAVE N'T Harry yelled
YOUVE GOT THE WRONG MANMinister , listen , please , Hermione said ; she had hurried to Harry 's side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge 's face
I saw him too
It was Ron 's rat , he 's an Animagus , Pettigrew , I mean , and -- You see , Minister ? said Snape
Confunded , both of them
Black 's done a very good job on them
WE 'RE NOT CONFUNDED Harry roared
Minister Professor said Madam Pomfrey angrily
I must insist that you leave
Potter is my patient , and he should not be distressedI 'm not distressed , I 'm trying to tell them what happened Harry said furiously
If they 'd just listen -- But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into Harry 's mouth ; he choked , and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed
Now , please , Minister , these children need care
Please leaveThe door opened again
It was Dumbledore
Harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again
Professor Dumbledore , Sirius Black -- For heaven 's sake said Madam Pomfrey hysterically
Is this a hospital wing or not ? Headmaster , I must insist -- My apologies , Poppy , but I need a word with Mr
Potter and Miss Granger , said Dumbledore calmly
I have just been talking to Sirius Black -- I suppose he 's told you the same fairy tale he 's planted in Potter 's mind ? spat Snape
Something about a rat , and Pettigrew being alive -- That , indeed , is Black 's story , said Dumbledore , surveying Snape closely through his half-moon spectacles
And does my evidence count for nothing ? snarled Snape
Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack , nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds
That was because you were knocked out , Professor said Hermione earnestly
You did n't arrive in time to hearMiss Granger , HOLD YOUR TONGUENow , Snape , said Fudge , startled , the young lady is disturbed in her mind , we must make allowances -- I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone , said Dumbledore abruptly
Cornelius , Severus , Poppy -- please leave us
Headmaster sputtered Madam Pomfrey
They need treatment , they need rest -- This can not wait , said Dumbledore
I must insist
Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward , slamming the door behind her
Fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat
The dementors should have arrived by now , he said
I 'll go and meet them
Dumbledore , I 'll see you upstairs
He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape , but Snape had n't moved
You surely do n't believe a word of Black 's story ? Snape whispered , his eyes fixed on Dumbledore 's face
I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone , Dumbledore repeated
Snape took a step toward Dumbledore
Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen , he breathed
You have n't forgotten that , Headmaster ? You have n't forgotten that he once tried to kill me ? My memory is as good as it ever was , Severus , said Dumbledore quietly
Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still holding
It closed behind them , and Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione
They both burst into speech at the same time
Professor , Black 's telling the truth -- we saw Pettigrew -- he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf -- -- he 's a rat -- -- Pettigrew 's front paw , I mean , finger , he cut it off -- -- Pettigrew attacked Ron , it was n't Sirius -- But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations
It is your turn to listen , and I beg you will not interrupt me , because there is very little time , he said quietly
There is not a shred of proof to support Black 's story , except your word -- and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody
A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew
I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters ' Secret-Keeper
Professor Lupin can tell you -- Harry said , unable to stop himselfProfessor Lupin is currently deep in the forest , unable to tell anyone anything
By the time he is human again , it will be too late , Sirius will be worse than dead
I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little -- and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends -- But -- Listen to me , Harry
It is too late , you understand me ? You must see that Professor Snape 's version of events is far more convincing than yours
He hates Sirius , Hermione said desperately
All because of some stupid trick Sirius played on him -- Sirius has not acted like an innocent man
The attack on the Fat Lady -- entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife -- without Pettigrew , alive or dead , we have no chance of overturning Sirius 's sentence
But you believe us
Yes , I do , said Dumbledore quietly
But I have no power to make other men see the truth , or to overrule the Minister of Magic
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away
He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything
He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air
their last hope was gone
What we need , said Dumbledore slowly , and his light blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione , is more time
But -- Hermione began
And then her eyes became very round
OHNow , pay attention , said Dumbledore , speaking very low , and very clearly
Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick 's office on the seventh floor
Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower
If all goes well , you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight
But remember this , both of you : you must not be seen
Miss Granger , you know the law -- you know what is at stake
You -- must -- not -- be -- seen
Harry did n't have a clue what was going on
Dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door
I am going to lock you in
It is -- he consulted his watch , five minutes to midnight
Miss Granger , three turns should do it
Good luck ? Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore
Three turns ? What 's he talking about ? What are we supposed to do ? But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes , pulling from beneath them a very long , very fine gold chain
Harry , come here , she said urgently
QuickHarry moved toward her , completely bewildered
She was holding the chain out
He saw a tiny , sparkling hourglass hanging from it
Here -- She had thrown the chain around his neck too
Ready ? she said breathlessly
What are we doing ? Harry said , completely lost
Hermione turned the hourglass over three times
The dark ward dissolved
Harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast , backward
A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him , his ears were pounding , he tried to yell but could n't hear his own voice -- And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet , and everything came into focus again -- He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors
He looked wildly around at Hermione , the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck
Hermione , what -- ? In here Hermione seized Harry 's arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet ; she opened it , pushed him inside among the buckets and mops , then slammed the door behind them
What -- how -- Hermione , what happened ? We 've gone back in time , Hermione whispered , lifting the chain off Harry 's neck in the darkness
Three hours back
Harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch
It hurt a lot , which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream
But -- Shh Listen Someone 's coming I think -- I think it might be us Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door
Footsteps across the hall
yes , I think it 's us going down to Hagrid'sAre you telling me , Harry whispered , that we 're here in this cupboard and we 're out there too ? Yes , said Hermione , her ear still glued to the cupboard door
I 'm sure it 's us
It does n't sound like more than three people
and we 're walking slowly because we 're under the Invisibility Cloak -- She broke off , still listening intently
We 've gone down the front steps
Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket , looking desperately anxious , but Harry wanted a few questions answered
Where did you get that hourglass thing ? It 's called a Time-Turner , Hermione whispered , and I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day back
I 've been using it all year to get to all my lessons
Professor McGonagall made me swear I would n't tell anyone
She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one
She had to tell them that I was a model student , and that I 'd never , ever use it for anything except my studies
I 've been turning it back so I could do hours over again , that 's how I 've been doing several lessons at once , see ? But
Harry , I do n't understand what Dumbledore wants us to do
Why did he tell us to go back three hours ? How 's that going to help Sirius ? Harry stared at her shadowy face
There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change , he said slowly
What happened ? We were walking down to Hagrid 's three hours ago
This is three hours ago , and we are walking down to Hagrid 's , said Hermione
We just heard ourselves leaving
Harry frowned ; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration
Dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent life
And then it hit him
Hermione , we 're going to save BuckbeakBut -- how will that help Sirius ? Dumbledore said -- he just told us where the window is -- the window of Flitwick 's office Where they 've got Sirius locked up We 've got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius Sirius can escape on Buckbeak -- they can escape togetherFrom what Harry could see of Hermione 's face , she looked terrified
If we manage that without being seen , it 'll be a miracleWell , we 've got to try , have n't we ? said Harry
He stood up and pressed his ear against the door
Does n't sound like anyone 's there
Come on , let 's go
Harry pushed open the closet door
The entrance hall was deserted
As quietly and quickly as they could , they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps
The shadows were already lengthening , the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold
If anyone 's looking out of the window -- Hermione squeaked , looking up at the castle behind them
We 'll run for it , said Harry determinedly
Straight into the forest , all right ? We 'll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout -- Okay , but we 'll go around by the greenhouses said Hermione breathlessly
We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid 's front door , or we 'll see us We must be nearly at Hagrid 's by nowStill working out what she meant , Harry set off at a sprint , Hermione behind him
They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses , paused for a moment behind them , then set off again , fast as they could , skirting around the Whomping Willow , tearing toward the shelter of the forest
Safe in the shadows of the trees , Harry turned around ; seconds later , Hermione arrived beside him , panting
Right , she gasped
We need to sneak over to Hagrid 's
Keep out of sight , Harry
They made their way silently through the trees , keeping to the very edge of the forest
Then , as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid 's house , they heard a knock upon his door
They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side
Hagrid had appeared in his doorway , shaking and white , looking around to see who had knocked
And Harry heard his own voice
We 're wearing the Invisibility Cloak
Let us in and we can take it off
Yeh shouldn 've come Hagrid whispered
He stood back , then shut the door quickly
This is the weirdest thing we 've ever done , Harry said fervently
Let 's move along a bit , Hermione whispered
We need to get nearer to BuckbeakThey crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff , tethered to the fence around Hagrid 's pumpkin patch
Now ? Harry whispered
No said Hermione
If we steal him now , those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free We 've got to wait until they 've seen he 's tied outsideThat 's going to give us about sixty seconds , said Harry
This was starting to seem impossible
At that moment , there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid 's cabin
That 's Hagrid breaking the milk jug , Hermione whispered
I 'm going to find Scabbers in a moment -- Sure enough , a few minutes later , they heard Hermione 's shriek of surprise
Hermione , said Harry suddenly , what if we -- we just run in there and grab Pettigrew -- No said Hermione in a terrified whisper
Do n't you understand ? We 're breaking one of the most important wizarding laws Nobody 's supposed to change time , nobody You heard Dumbledore , if we 're seen -- We 'd only be seen by ourselves and HagridHarry , what do you think you 'd do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid 's house ? said Hermione
I 'd -- I 'd think I 'd gone mad , said Harry , or I 'd think there was some Dark Magic going on -- Exactly You would n't understand , you might even attack yourself Do n't you see ? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time
Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistakeOkay said Harry
It was just an idea , I just thoughtBut Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle
Harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors
Dumbledore , Fudge , the old Committee member , and Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps
We 're about to come out Hermione breathed
And sure enough , moments later , Hagrid 's back door opened , and Harry saw himself , Ron , and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid
It was , without a doubt , the strangest sensation of his life , standing behind the tree , and watching himself in the pumpkin patch
It 's Okay , Beaky , it 's okay
Hagrid said to Buckbeak
Then he turned to Harry , Ron , and Hermione
Hagrid , we ca n't -- We 'll tell them what really happenedThey ca n't kill him -- Go It 's bad enough without you lot in trouble an ' allHarry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron
There was a knock on Hagrid 's front door
The execution party had arrived
Hagrid turned , around and headed back into his cabin , leaving the back door ajar
Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating
He , Ron , and Hermione had gone
but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door
Where is the beast ? came the cold voice of Macnair
Out -- outside , Hagrid croaked
Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair 's face appeared at Hagrid 's window , staring out at Buckbeak
Then they heard Fudge
We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution , Hagrid
I 'll make it quick
And then you and Macnair need to sign it
Macnair , You 're supposed to listen too , that 's procedure -- Macnair 's face vanished from the window
It was now or never
Wait here , Harry whispered to Hermione
I 'll do it
As Fudge 's voice started again , Harry darted out from behind his tree , vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch , and approached Buckbeak
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak , hereafter called the condemned , shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown -- Careful not to blink , Harry stared up into Buckbeak 's fierce orange eyes once more and bowed
Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again
Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the fence
sentenced to execution by beheading , to be carried out by the Committee 's appointed executioner , Walden Macnai
Come on , Buckbeak , Harry murmured , come on , we 're going to help you
as witnessed below
Hagrid , you sign here
Harry threw all his weight onto the rope , but Buckbeak had dug in his front feet
Well , let 's get this over with , said the reedy voice of the Committee member from inside Hagrid 's cabin
Hagrid , perhaps it will be better if you stay inside -- No , I -- I wan ' ter be with him
I don ' wan ' him ter be alone -- Footsteps echoed from within the cabin
Buckbeak , move Harry hissed
Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak 's neck
The hippogriff began to walk , rustling its wings irritably
They were still ten feet away from the forest , in plain view of Hagrid 's back door
One moment , please , Macnair , came Dumbledore 's voice
You need to sign too
The footsteps stopped
Harry heaved on the rope
Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster
Hermione 's white face was sticking out from behind a tree
Harry , hurry she mouthed
Harry could still hear Dumbledore 's voice talking from within the cabin
He gave the rope another wrench
Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot
They had reached the trees
Quick Quick Hermione moaned , darting out from behind her tree , seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster
Harry looked over his shoulder ; they were now blocked from sight ; they could n't see Hagrid 's garden at all
Stop he whispered to Hermione
They might hear usHagrid 's back door had opened with a bang
Harry , Hermione , and Buckbeak stood quite still ; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently
then -- Where is it ? said the reedy voice of the Committee member
Where is the beast ? It was tied here said the executioner furiously
I saw it just hereHow extraordinary , said Dumbledore
There was a note of amusement in his voice
Beaky said Hagrid huskily
There was a swishing noise , and the thud of an axe
The executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger
And then came the howling , and this time they could hear Hagrid 's words through his sobs
Gone Gone Bless his little beak , he 's gone Musta pulled himself free Beaky , yeh clever boyBuckbeak started to strain against the rope , trying to get back to Hagrid
Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him
Someone untied him the executioner was snarling
We should search the grounds , the forest
Macnair , if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen , do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot ? said Dumbledore , still sounding amused
Search the skies , if you will
Hagrid , I could do with a cup of tea
Or a large brandy
O ' -- o ' course , Professor , said Hagrid , who sounded weak with happiness
Come in , come in
Harry and Hermione listened closely
They heard footsteps , the soft cursing of the executioner , the snap of the door , and then silence once more
Now what ? whispered Harry , looking around
We 'll have to hide in here , said Hermione , who looked very shaken
We need to wait until they 've gone back to the castle
Then we wait until it 's safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius 's window
He wo n't be there for another couple of hours
Oh , this is going to be difficult
She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest
The sun was setting now
We 're going to have to move , said Harry , thinking hard
We 've got to be able to see the Whomping Willow , or we wo n't know what 's going on
Okay , said Hermione , getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak 's rope
But we 've got to keep out of sight , Harry , remember
They moved around the edge of the forest , darkness falling thickly around them , until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the Willow
There 's Ron said Harry suddenly
A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air
Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers , come here -- And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere
Harry watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron
Then he saw Ron dive
Gotcha Get off , you stinking cat -- There 's Sirius said Harry
The great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the Willow
They saw him bowl Harry over , then seize Ron
Looks even worse from here , does n't it ? said Harry , watching the dog pulling Ron into the roots
Ouch -- look , I just got walloped by the tree -- and so did you -- this is weird -- The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches ; they could see themselves darting here and there , trying to reach the trunk
And then the tree froze
That was Crookshanks pressing the knot , said Hermione
And there we go
The moment they disappeared , the tree began to move again
Seconds later , they heard footsteps quite close by
Dumbledore , Macnair , Fudge , and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle
Right after we 'd gone down into the passage said Hermione
If only Dumbledore had come with us
Macnair and Fudge would 've come too , said Harry bitterly
I bet you anything Fudge would 've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot
They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view
For a few minutes the scene was deserted
Then -- Here comes Lupin said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and hating toward the Willow
Harry looked up at the sky
Clouds were obscuring the moon completely
They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk
The tree stopped fighting , and Lupin , too , disappeared into the gap in its roots
If he 'd only grabbed the cloak , said Harry
It 's just lying there
He turned to Hermione
If I just dashed out now and grabbed it , Snape 'd never be able to get it and -- Harry , we must n't be seenHow can you stand this ? he asked Hermione fiercely
Just standing here and watching it happen ? He hesitated
I 'm going to grab the cloakHarry , noHermione seized the back of Harry 's robes not a moment too soon
just then , they heard a burst of song
It was Hagrid , making his way up to the castle , singing at the top of his voice , and weaving slightly as he walked
A large bottle was swinging from his hands
See ? Hermione whispered
See what would have happened ? We 've got to keep out of sight No , BuckbeakThe hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again ; Harry seized his rope too , straining to hold Buckbeak back
They watched Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle
He was gone
Buckbeak stopped fighting to get away
His head drooped sadly
Barely two minutes later , the castle doors flew open yet again , and Snape came charging out of them , running toward the Willow
Harry 's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree , looking around
He grabbed the cloak and held it up
Get your filthy hands off it , Harry snarled under his breath
ShhSnape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree , prodded the knot , and vanished from view as he put on the cloak
So that 's it , said Hermione quietly
We 're all down there
and now we 've just got to wait until we come back up again
She took the end of Buckbeak 's rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree , then sat down on the dry ground , arms around her knees
Harry , there 's something I do n't understand
Why did n't the dementors get Sirius ? I remember them coming , and then I think I passed out
there were so many of them
Harry sat down too
He explained what he 'd seen ; how , as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry 's , a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat
Hermione 's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished
But what was it ? There 's only one thing it could have been , to make the dementors go , said Harry
A real Patronus
A powerful one
But who conjured it ? Harry did n't say anything
He was thinking back to the person he 'd seen on the other bank of the lake
He knew who he thought it had been
but how could it have been ? Did n't you see what they looked like ? said Hermione eagerly
Was it one of the teachers ? No , said Harry
He was n't a teacher
But it must have been a really powerful wizard , to drive all those dementors away
If the Patronus was shining so brightly , did n't it light him up ? Could n't you see -- ? Yeah , I saw him , said Harry slowly
maybe I imagined it
I was n't thinking straight
I passed out right afterward
Who did you think it was ? I think -- Harry swallowed , knowing how strange this was going to sound
I think it was my dad
Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now
She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity
Harry , your dad 's -- well -- dead , she said quietly
I know that , said Harry quickly
You think you saw his ghost ? I do n't know
he looked solid
But then -- Maybe I was seeing things , said Harry
from what I could see
it looked like him
I 've got photos of him
Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity
I know it sounds crazy , said Harry flatly
He turned to took at Buckbeak , who was digging his beak into the ground , apparently searching for worms
But he was n't really watching Buckbeak
He was thinking about his father and about his father 's three oldest friends
Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs
Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight ? Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead
Was it so impossible his father had done the same ? Had he been seeing things across the take ? The figure had been too far away to see distinctly
yet he had felt sure , for a moment , before he 'd lost consciousness
The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze
The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds
Hermione sat with her face turned toward the Willow , waiting
And then , at last , after over an hour
Here we come Hermione whispered
She and Harry got to their feet
Buckbeak raised his head
They saw Lupin , Ron , and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots
Then came Hermione
then the unconscious Snape , drifting weirdly upward
Next came Harry and Black
They all began to walk toward the castle
Harry 's heart was starting to beat very fast
He glanced up at the sky
Any moment now , that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon
Harry , Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking , we 've got to stay put
We must n't be seen
There 's nothing we can do
So we 're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again
said Harry quietly
How do you expect to find a rat in the dark ? snapped Hermione
There 's nothing we can do We came back to help Sirius ; we 're not supposed to be doing anything elseAll rightThe moon slid out from behind its cloud
They saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop
Then they saw movement -- There goes Lupin , Hermione whispered
He 's transformingHermione said Harry suddenly
We 've got to moveWe must n't , I keep telling you -- Not to interfere Lupin 's going to run into the forest , right at usHermione gasped
Quick she moaned , dashing to untie Buckbeak
Quick Where are we going to go ? Where are we going to hide ? The dementors wilt be coming any moment -- Back to Hagrid 's Harry said
It 's empty now -- come onThey ran as fast as they could , Buckbeak cantering along behind them
They could hear the werewolf howling behind them
The cabin was in sight ; Harry skidded to the door , wrenched it open , and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him ; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door
Fang the boarhound barked loudly
Shh , Fang , it 's us said Hermione , hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him
That was really close she said to Harry
Harry was looking out of the window
It was much harder to see what was going on from here
Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside Hagrid 's house
He lay down in front of the fire , folded his wings contentedly , and seemed ready for a good nap
I think I 'd better go outside again , you know , said Harry slowly
I ca n't see what 's going on -- we wo n't know when it 's time -- Hermione looked up
Her expression was suspicious
I 'm not going to try and interfere , said Harry quickly
But if we do n't see what 's going on , how 're we going to know when it 's time to rescue Sirius ? Well
I 'll wait here with Buckbeak
but Harry , be careful -- there 's a werewolf out there -- and the dementorsHarry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin
He could hear yelping in the distance
That meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius
He and Hermione would be running to him any moment
Harry stared out toward the lake , his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest
Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any moment
For a fraction of a second he stood , irresolute , in front of Hagrid 's door
You must not be seen
But he did n't want to be seen
He wanted to do the seeing
He had to know
And there were the dementors
They were emerging out of the darkness from every direction , gliding around the edges of the lake
They were moving away from where Harry stood , to the opposite bank
He would n't have to get near them
Harry began to run
He had no thought in his head except his father
If it was him
if it really was him
he had to know , had to find out
The lake was coming nearer and nearer , but there was no sign of anybody
On the opposite bank , he could see tiny glimmers of silver -- his own attempts at a Patronus -- There was a bush at the very edge of the water
Harry threw himself behind it , peering desperately through the leaves
On the opposite bank , the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished
A terrified excitement shot through him -- any moment now -- Come on he muttered , staring about
Where are you ? Dad , come on -- But no one came
Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake
One of them was lowering its hood
It was time for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help this time -- And then it hit him -- he understood
He had n't seen his father -- he had seen himself -- Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand
EXPECTO PATRONUM he yelled
And out of the end of his wand burst , not a shapeless cloud of mist , but a blinding , dazzling , silver animal
He screwed up his eyes , trying to see what it was
It looked like a horse
It was galloping silently away from him , across the black surface of the lake
He saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors
Now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground , and the dementors were falling back , scattering , retreating into the darkness
They were gone
The Patronus turned
It was cantering back toward Harry across the still surface of the water
It was n't a horse
It was n't a unicorn , either
It was a stag
It was shining brightly as the moon above
it was coming back to him
It stopped on the bank
Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at Harry with its large , silver eyes
Slowly , it bowed its antlered head
And Harry realized
Prongs , he whispered
But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature , it vanished
Harry stood there , hand still outstretched
Then , with a great leap of his heart , he heard hooves behind him -he whirled around and saw Hermione dashing toward him , dragging Buckbeak behind her
What did you do ? she said fiercely
You said you were only going to keep a lookoutI just saved all our lives
, said Harry
Get behind here -- behind this bush -- I 'll explain
Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again
Did anyone see you ? Yes , have n't you been listening ? I saw me but I thought I was my dad It 's okayHarry , I ca n't believe it
You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors That 's very , very advanced magic
I knew I could do it this time , said Harry , because I 'd already done it
Does that make sense ? I do n't know -- Harry , look at SnapeTogether they peered around the bush at the other bank
Snape had regained consciousness
He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry , Hermione , and Black onto them
A fourth stretcher , no doubt bearing Ron , was already floating at his side
Then , wand held out in front of him , he moved them away toward the castle
Right , it 's nearly time , said Hermione tensely , looking at her watch
We 've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing
We 've got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we 're missing
11They waited , watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake , while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze
Buckbeak , bored , was ferreting for worms again
D ' you reckon he 's up there yet ? said Harry , checking his watch
He looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the West Tower
Look Hermione whispered
\Who 's that ? Someone 's coming back out of the castleHarry stared through the darkness
The man was hurrying across the grounds , toward one of the entrances
Something shiny glinted in his belt
Macnair said Harry
The executioner He 's gone to get the dementors This is it , Hermione -- Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak 's back and Harry gave her a leg up
Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her
He pulled Buckbeak 's rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins
Ready ? he whispered to Hermione
YotM better hold on to me -- He nudged Buckbeak 's sides with his heels
Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air
Harry gripped his flanks with his knees , feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them
Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the waist ; he could hear her muttering , Oh , no -- I do n't like this oh , I really do n't like this -- Harry urged Buckbeak forward
They were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle
Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the rope , and Buckbeak turned
Harry was trying to count the windows flashing past -- Whoa he said , pulling backward as hard as he could
Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop , unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne
He 's there Harry said , spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the window
He reached out , and as Buckbeak 's wings fell , was able to tap sharply on the glass
Black looked up
Harry saw his jaw drop
He leapt from his chair , hurried to the window and tried to open it , but it was locked
Stand back Hermione called to him , and she took out her wand , still gripping the back of Harry 's robes with her left hand
AlohomoraThe window sprang open
How -- how -- ? said Black weakly , staring at the hippogriffGet on -- there 's not much time , said Harry , gripping Buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady
You 've got to get out of here -the dementors are coming -- Macnair 's gone to get them
Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it
It was very lucky he was so thin
In seconds , he had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak 's back and pull himself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione
Okay , Buckbeak , up said Harry , shaking the rope
Up to the tower -- come on
The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again , high as the top of the West Tower
Buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements , and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once
Sirius , you 'd better go , quick , Harry panted
They 'll reach Flitwick 's office any moment , they 'll find out you 're gone
Buckbeak pawed the ground , tossing his sharp head
What happened to the other boy ? Ron ? croaked Sirius
He 's going to be okay
He 's still out of it , but Madam Pomfrey says she 'll be able to make him better
Quick -- go -- But Black was still staring down at Harry
How can I ever thank -- GO Harry and Hermione shouted together
Black wheeled Buckbeak around , facing the open sky
We 'll see each other again , he said
You are -- truly your father 's son , Harry
He squeezed Buckbeak 's sides with his heels
Harry and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more
The hippogriff took off into the air
He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry gazed after them
then a cloud drifted across the moon
They were gone
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWOOWL POST AGAINHarryHermione was tugging at his sleeve , staring at her watch
We 've got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us -- before Dumbledore locks the door -- Okay , said Harry , wrenching his gaze from the sky , let 's go
They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase
As they reached the bottom of it , they heard voices
They flattened themselves against the wall and listened
It sounded like Fudge and Snape
They were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase
only hope Dumbledore 's not going to make difficulties , Snape was saying
The Kiss will be performed immediately ? As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors
This whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing
I ca n't tell you how much I 'm looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we 've got him at last
I daresay they 'll want to interview you , Snape
and once young Harry 's back in his right mind , I expect he 'll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you saved him
Harry clenched his teeth
He caught a glimpse of Snape 's smirk as he and Fudge passed Harry and Hermione 's hiding place
Their footsteps died away
Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they 'd really gone , then started to run in the opposite direction
Down one staircase , then another , along a new , corridor -- then they heard a cackling ahead
Peeves Harry muttered , grabbing Hermione 's wrist
In hereThey tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time
Peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits , laughing his head off
Oh , he 's horrible , whispered Hermione , her ear to the door
I bet he 's all excited because the dementors are going to finish off Sirius
She checked her watch
Three minutes , HarryThey waited until Peeves 's gloating voice had faded into the distance , then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again
Hermione -- what 'll happen -- if we do n't get back inside before Dumbledore locks the door ? Harry panted
I do n't want to think about it Hermione moaned , checking her watch again
One minuteThey had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance
Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore , said Hermione tensely
Come on , HarryThey crept along the corridor
The door opened
Dumbledore 's back appeared
I am going to lock you in , they heard him saying
it is five minutes to midnight
Miss Granger , three turns should do It
Dumbledore backed out of the room , closed the door , and took out his wand to magically lock it
Panicking , Harry and Hermione ran forward
Dumbledore looked up , and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache
Well ? he said quietly
We did it said Harry breathlessly
Sirius has gone , on Buckbeak
Dumbledore beamed at them
I think -- He listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing
Yes , I think you 've gone too -- get inside -- I 'll lock you in -- Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory
It was empty except for Ron , who was still lying motionless in the end bed
As the lock clicked behind them , Harry and Hermione crept back to their own beds , Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes
A moment later , Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office
Did I hear the headmaster leaving ? Am I allowed to look after my patients now ? She was in a very bad mood
Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly
Madam Pomfrey stood over them , making sure they ate it
But Harry could hardly swallow
He and Hermione were waiting , listening , their nerves jangling
And then , as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey , they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them
What was that ? said Madam Pomfrey in alarm
Now they could hear angry voices , growing louder and louder
Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door
Really -- they 'll wake everybody up What do they think they 're doing ? Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying
They were drawing nearer -- He must have Disapparated , Severus
We should have left somebody in the room with him
When this gets out -- HE DID N'T DISAPPARATE Snape roared , now very close at hand
YOU CA N'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE THIS -- HAS -- SOMETHING -- TO -- DO -- WITH -- POTTERSeverus -- be reasonable -- Harry has been locked up -- BAM
The door of the hospital wing burst open
Fudge , Snape , and Dumbledore came striding into the ward
Dumbledore alone looked calm
Indeed , he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself
Fudge appeared angry
But Snape was beside himself
OUT WITH IT , POTTER he bellowed
WHAT DID YOU DO ? Professor Snape shrieked Madam Pomfrey
Control yourselfSee here , Snape , be reasonable , said Fudge
This door 's been locked , we just saw -- THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE , I KNOW IT Snape howled , pointing at Harry and Hermione
His face was twisted ; spit was flying from his mouth
Calm down , man Fudge barked
You 're talking nonsenseYOU DO N'T KNOW POTTER shrieked Snape
HE DID IT , I KNOW HE DID IT -- That will do , Severus , said Dumbledore quietly
Think about what you are saying
This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago
Madam Pomfrey , have these students left their beds ? Of course not said Madam Pomfrey , bristling
I would have heard themWell , there you have it , Severus , said Dumbledore calmly
Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once , I 'm afraid I do n't see any point in troubling them further
Snape stood there , seething , staring from Fudge , who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior , to Dumbledore , whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses
Snape whirled about , robes swishing behind him , and stormed out of the ward
Fellow seems quite unbalanced , said Fudge , staring after him
I 'd watch out for him if I were you , Dumbledore
Oh , he 's not unbalanced , said Dumbledore quietly
He 's just suffered a severe disappointment
He 's not the only one puffed Fudge
The Daily Prophet 's going to have a field day We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff 's escape to get out , and I 'll be a laughingstock Well
I 'd better go and notify the Ministry
And the dementors ? said Dumbledore
They 'll be removed from the school , I trust ? Oh yes , they 'll have to go , said Fudge , running his fingersdistractedly through his hair
Never dreamed they 'd attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent boy
Completely out of control
no , I 'll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight
Perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance
Hagrid would like that , said Dumbledore , smiling at Harry and Hermione
As he and Fudge left the dormitory , Madam Pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again
Muttering angrily to herself , she headed back to her office
There was a low moan from the other end of the ward
Ron had woken up
They could see him sitting up , rubbing his head , looking around
What -- what happened ? he groaned
Harry ? Why are we in here ? Where 's Sirius ? Where 's Lupin ? What 's going on ? Harry and Hermione looked at each other
You explain , said Harry , helping himself to some more chocolate
When Harry , Ron , and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day , it was to find an almost deserted castle
The sweltering , heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another Hogsmeade visit
Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going , however , so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds , still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now
Sitting near the lake , watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water , Harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank
The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night
A shadow fell across them and they looked 'tip to see a very bleary-eyed Hagrid , mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them
Know I shouldn ' feel happy , after wha ' happened las ' night , he said
I mean , Black escapin ' again , an , everythin ' -- but guess what ? What ? they said , pretending to look curious
Beaky He escaped He 's free Bin celebratin ' all nightThat 's wonderful said Hermione , giving Ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing
can't 've tied him up properly , said Hagrid , gazing happily out over the grounds
I was worried this mornin ' , mind
thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds , but Lupin says he never ate anythin ' las ' night
What ? said Harry quickly
Blimey , haven ' yeh heard ? said Hagrid , his smile fading a little
He lowered his voice , even though there was nobody in sight
Er -- Snape told all the Slytherins this mornin
Thought everyone 'd know by now
Professor Lupin 's a werewolf , see
An ' he was loose on the grounds las ' night
He 's packin ' now , o ' course
He 's packing ? said Harry , alarmed
Why ? Leavin ' , isn ' he ? said Hagrid , looking surprised that Harry had to ask
Resigned firs ' thing this mornin
Says he ca n't risk it happenin again
Harry scrambled to his feet
I 'm going to see him , he said to Ron and Hermione
But if he 's resigned -- -- does n't sound like there 's anything we can do -- I do n't care
I still want to see him
I 'll meet you back here
Lupin 's office door was open
He had already packed most of his things
The grindylow 's empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase , which was open and nearly full
Lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door
I saw you coming , said Lupin , smiling
He pointed to the parchment he had been poring over
It was the Marauder 's Map
I just saw Hagrid , said Harry
And he said you 'd resigned
It 's not true , is it ? I 'm afraid it is , said Lupin
He started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents
Why ? said Harry
The Ministry of Magic do n't think you were helping Sirius , do they ? Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry
Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to save your lives
That was the final straw for Severus
I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard
So he -- er -- accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast
You 're not leaving just because of that said Harry
Lupin smiled wryly
This time tomorrow , the owls will start arriving from parents
They will not want a werewolf teaching their children , Harry
And after last night , I see their point
I could have bitten any of you
That must never happen again
You 're the best Defense Against the Dark Arts- teacher we 've ever had said Harry
Do n't goLupin shook his head and did n't speak
He carried on emptying his drawers
Then , while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay , Lupin said , From what the headmaster told me this morning , you saved a lot of lives last night , Harry
if I 'm proud of anything I 've done this year , it 's how much you 've learned
Tell me about your Patronus
How d'you know about that ? said Harry , distracted
What else could have driven the dementors back ? Harry told Lupin what had happened
When he 'd finished , Lupin was smiling again
Yes , your father was always a stag when he transformed , he said
You guessed right
that 's why we called him Prongs
Lupin threw his last few books into his case , closed the desk drawers , and turned to look at Harry
Here -- I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night , he said , handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak
He hesitated , then held out the Marauder 's Map too
I am no longer your teacher , so I do n't feel guilty about giving you back this as well
It 's no use to me , and I daresay you , Ron , and Hermione will find uses for it
Harry took the map and grinned
You told me Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs would 've wanted to lure me out of school
you said they 'd have thought it was funny
And so we would have , said Lupin , now reaching down to close his case
I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle
There was a knock on the door
Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder 's Map and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket
It was Professor Dumbledore
He did n't look surprised to see Harry there
Your carriage is at the gates , Remus , he said
Thank You , Headmaster
Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank
Well -- good-bye , Harry , he said , smiling
It has been a real pleasure teaching you
I feel sure we 'll meet again sometime
Headmaster , there is no need to see me to the gates , I can manage
Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible
Good-bye , then , Remus , said Dumbledore soberly
Lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands
Then , with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile , Lupin left the office
Harry sat down in his vacated chair , staring glumly at the floor
He heard the door close and looked up
Dumbledore was still there
Why so miserable , Harry ? he said quietly
You should be very proud of yourself after last night
It did n't make any difference , said Harry bitterly
Pettigrew got away
Did n't make any difference ? said Dumbledore quietly , It made all the difference in the world , Harry
You helped uncover the truth
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate
Something stirred in Harry 's memory
Greater and more terrible than ever before
Professor Trelawney 's predictionProfessor Dumbledore -- yesterday , when I was having my Divination exam , Professor Trelawney went very -- very strange
Indeed ? said Dumbledore
Er -- stranger than usual , you mean ? Yes
her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said
she said Voldemort 's servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight
She said the servant would help him come back to power
Harry stared up at Dumbledore
And then she sort of became normal again , and she could n't remember anything she 'd said
Was it -- was she making a real prediction ? Dumbledore looked mildly impressed
Do you know , Harry , I think she might have been
he said thoughtfully
Who 'd have thought it ? That brings her total of real predictions up to two
I should offer her a pay raise
But -- Harry looked at him , aghast
How could Dumbledore take this so calmly ? But -- I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes backIt does not , said Dumbledore quietly
Has n't your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything , Harry ? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated , so diverse , that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed
Professor Trelawney , bless her , is living proof of that
You did a very noble thing , in saving Pettigrew 's life
But if he helps Voldemort back to powerPettigrew owes his life to you
You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt
When one wizard saves another wizard 's life , it creates a certain bond between them
and I 'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter
I do n't want a connection with Pettigrew said Harry
He betrayed my parentsThis is magic at its deepest , its most impenetrable , Harry
But trust me
the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew 's life
Harry could n't imagine when that would be
Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking
I knew your father very well , both at Hogwarts and later , Harry , he said gently
He would have saved Pettigrew too , I am sure of it
Harry looked up at him
Dumbledore would n't laugh -- he could tell Dumbledore
I thought it was my dad who 'd conjured my Patronus
I mean , when I saw myself across the lake
I thought I was seeing him
An easy mistake to make , said Dumbledore softly
I expect you 'll tire of hearing it , but you do look extraordinarily like James
Except for the eyes
you have your mother 's eyes
Harry shook his head
It was stupid , thinking it was him , he muttered
I mean , I knew he was dead
You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us ? You think that we do n't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble ? Your father is alive in you , Harry , and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him
How else could you produce that particular Patronus ? Prongs rode again last night
It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said
Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi , said Dumbledore , smiling
An extraordinary achievement -- not least , keeping it quiet from me
And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took , when it charged Mr
Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw
You know , Harry , in a way , you did see your father last night
You found him inside yourself
And Dumbledore left the office , leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts
Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius , Buckbeak , and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry , Ron , Hermione , and Professor Dumbledore
As the end of term approached , Harry heard many different theories about what had really happened , but none of them came close to the truth
Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak
He was convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety , and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper
Percy Weasley , meanwhile , had much to say on the subject of Sirius 's escape
If I manage to get into the Ministry , I 'll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement he told the only person who would listen -- his girlfriend , Penelope
Though the weather was perfect , though the atmosphere was socheerful , though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom , Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits
He certainly was n't the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin go
The whole of Harry 's Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his resignation
Wonder what they 'll give us next year ? said Seamus Finnigan gloomily
Maybe a vampire , suggested Dean Thomas hopefully
It was n't only Professor Lupin 's departure that was weighing on Harry 's mind
He could n't help thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney 's prediction
He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now , whether he had sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet
But the thing that was lowering Harry 's spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the Dursleys
For maybe half an hour , a glorious half hour , he had believed he would be living with Sirius from now on
his parents ' best friend
It would have been the next best thing to having his own father back
And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news , because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding , Harry could n't help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had , and the fact that it was now impossible
The exam results came out on the last day of term
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had passed every subject
Harry was amazed that he had got through Potions
He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose
Snape 's behavior toward Harry over the past week had been quite alarming
Harry would n't have thought it possible that Snape 's dislike for him could increase , but it certainly had
A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape 's thin mouth every time he looked at Harry , and he was constantly flexing his fingers , as though itching to place them around Harry 's throat
Percy had got his top-grade N
s ; Fred and George had scraped a handful of O
Gryffindor House , meanwhile , largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup , had won the House championship for the third year running
This meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold , and that the Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot , as everybody celebrated
Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the next day as he ate , drank , talked , and laughed with the rest
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next mornIng , Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news
I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning , just before breakfast
I 've decided to drop Muggle Studies
But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent said Ron
I know , sighed Hermione , but I ca n't stand another year like this one
That Time-Turner , it was driving me mad
I 've handed it in
Without Muggle Studies and Divination , I 'll be able to have a normal schedule again
I still ca n't believe you did n't tell us about it , said Ron grumpily
We 're supposed to be your friends
I promised I would n't tell anyone , said Hermione severely
She looked around at Harry , who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain
Two whole months before he 'd see it again
Oh , cheer up , Harry said Hermione sadly
I 'm okay , said Harry quickly
Just thinking about the holidays
Yeah , I 've been thinking about them too , said Ron
Harry , you 've got to come and stay with us
I 'll fix it up with Mum and Dad , then I 'll call you
I know how to use a fellytone now -- A telephone , Ron , said Hermione
Honestly , you should take Muggle Studies next year
Ron ignored her
It 's the Quidditch World Cup this summer How about it , Harry ? Come and stay , and we 'll go and see it Dad can usually get tickets from work
This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal
I bet the Dursleys 'd be pleased to let me come
especially after what I did to Aunt Marge
Feeling considerably more cheerful , Harry joined Ron and Hermione in several games of Exploding Snap , and when the witch with the tea cart arrived , he bought himself a very large lunch , though nothing with chocolate in it
But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up
Harry , said Hermione suddenly , peering over his shoulder
What 's that thing outside your window ? Harry turned to look outside
Something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass
He stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl , carrying a letter that was much too big for it
The owl was so small , in fact , that it kept tumbling over in the air , buffeted this way and that in the train 's slipstream
Harry quickly pulled down the window , stretched out his arm , and caught it
It felt like a very fluffy Snitch
He brought it carefully inside
The owl dropped its letter onto Harry 's seat and began zooming around their compartment , apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task
Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval
Crookshanks sat up in his seat , following the owl with his great yellow eyes
Ron , noticing this , snatched the owl safely out of harm 's way
Harry picked up the letter
It was addressed to him
He ripped open the letter , and shouted , It 's from SiriusWhat ? said Ron and Hermione excitedly
Read it aloudDear Harry , I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle
I do n't know whether they 're used to owl post
Buckbeak and I are in hiding
I wo n't tell you where , in case this owl falls into the wrong hands
I have some doubt about his reliability , but he is the best I could find , and he did seem eager for the job
I believe the dementors are still searching for me , but they have n't a hope of finding me here
I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon , a long way from Hogwarts , so that the security on the castle will be lifted
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief meeting
It was I who sent you the Firebolt -- Ha said Hermione triumphantly
See I told you it was from himYes , but he had n't jinxed it , had he ? said Ron
Ouch The tiny owl , now hooting happily in his hand , had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way
Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me
I used your name but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault
Please consider it as thirteen birthdays ' worth of presents from your godfather
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that night last year when you left your uncle 's house
I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north , but I think the sight of me alarmed you
I am enclosing something else for you , which I think will make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable
If ever you need me , send word
Your owl will find me
I 'll write again soon
SiriusHarry looked eagerly inside the envelope
There was another piece of parchment in there
He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though he 'd swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp
I , Sirius Black , Harry Potter 's godfather , hereby give him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends
That 'll be good enough for Dumbledore said Harry happily
He looked back at Sirius 's letter
Hang on , there 's a RS
I thought your ftiend Ron might like to keep this owl , as it 's my fault he no longer has a rat
Ron 's eyes widened
The minute owl was still hooting excitedly
Keep him ? he said uncertainly
He looked closely at the owl for a moment ; then , to Harry 's and Hermione 's great surprise , he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff
What do you reckon ? Ron asked the cat
Definitely an owl ? Crookshanks purred
That 's good enough for me , said Ron happily
Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King 's Cross station
It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he , Ron , and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine an ' three-quarters
Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once
He was standing a good distance from Mr
Weasley , eyeing them suspiciously , and when Mrs
Weasley hugged Harry in greeting , his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed
I 'll call about the World Cup Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him and Hermione good-bye , then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig 's cage toward Uncle Vernon , who greeted him in his usual fashion
What 's that ? he snarled , staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching in his hand
If it 's another form for me to sign , you 've got another -- -It 's not , said Harry cheerfully
It 's a letter from my godfather
Godfather ? sputtered Uncle Vernon
You have n't got a godfatherYes , I have , said Harry brightly
He was my mum and dad 's best friend
He 's a convicted murderer , but he 's broken out of wizard prison and he 's on the run
He likes to keep in touch with me , though
keep up with my news
check if I 'm happy
And , grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon 's face , Harry set off toward the station exit , Hedwig rattling along in front of him , for what looked like a much better summer than the last
CHAPTER ONETHE WORST BIRTHDAYNot for the first time , an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four , Privet Drive
Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud , hooting noise from his nephew Harry 's room
Third time this week he roared across the table
If you ca n't control that owl , it 'll have to goHarry tried , yet again , to explain
She 's bored , he said
She 's used to flying around outside
If I could just let her out at night -Do I look stupid ? snarled Uncle Vernon , a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache
I know what 'll happen if that owl 's let out
He exchanged dark looks with his wife , Petunia
Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long , loud belch from the Dursleys ' son , Dudley
I want more bacon
There 's more in the frying pan , sweetums , said Aunt Petunia , turning misty eyes on her massive son
We must build you up while we 've got the chance
I do n't like the sound of that school food
Nonsense , Petunia , I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings , said Uncle Vernon heartily
Dudley gets enough , do n't you , son ? Dudley , who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair , grinned and turned to Harry
Pass the frying pan
You 've forgotten the magic word , said Harry irritably
The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible : Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen ; Mrs
Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth ; Mr
Dursley jumped to his feet , veins throbbing in his temples
I meant ` please ' said Harry quickly
I did n't mean -WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU , thundered his uncle , spraying spit over the table , ABOUT SAYING THE ` M ' WORD IN OUR HOUSE ? But I -HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY roared Uncle Vernon , pounding the table with his fist
I just -I WARNED YOU I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOFHarry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt , who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet
All right , said Harry , all right
Uncle Vernon sat back down , breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small , sharp eyes
Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays , Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment , because Harry Potter was n't a normal boy
As a matter of fact , he was as not normal as it is possible to be
Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays , it was nothing to how Harry felt
He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache
He missed the castle , with its secret passageways and ghosts , his classes though perhaps not Snape , the Potions master ) , the mail arriving by owl , eating banquets in the Great Hall , sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory , visiting the gamekeeper , Hagrid , in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds , and , especially , Quidditch , the most popular sport in the wizarding world six tall goal posts , four flying balls , and fourteen players on broomsticks )
All Harry 's spellbooks , his wand , robes , cauldron , and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home
What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he had n't practiced all summer ? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done ? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles not a drop of magical blood in their veins ) , and as far as they were concerned , having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame
Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry 's owl , Hedwig , inside her cage , to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family
Uncle Vernon was large and neckless , with an enormous black mustache ; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony ; Dudley was blond , pink , and porky
Harry , on the other hand , was small and skinny , with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy
He wore round glasses , and on his forehead was a thin , lightning-shaped scar
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual , even for a wizard
This scar was the only hint of Harry 's very mysterious past , of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys ' doorstep eleven years before
At the age of one year old , Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time , Lord Voldemort , whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak
Harry 's parents had died in Voldemort 's attack , but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar , and somehow - nobody understood why Voldemort 's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry
So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother 's sister and her husband
He had spent ten years with the Dursleys , never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to , believing the Dursleys ' story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents
And then , exactly a year ago , Hogwarts had written to Harry , and the whole story had come out
Harry had taken up his place at wizard school , where he and his scar were famous
but now the school year was over , and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer , back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly
The Dursleys had n't even remembered that today happened to be Harry 's twelfth birthday
Of course , his hopes had n't been high ; they 'd never given him a real present , let alone a cake - but to ignore it completely
At that moment , Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said , Now , as we all know , today is a very important day
Harry looked up , hardly daring to believe it
This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career , said Uncle Vernon
Harry went back to his toast
Of course , he thought bitterly , Un cle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party
He 'd been talk ing of nothing else for two weeks
Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him Uncle Vernon 's company made drills )
I think we should run through the schedule one more time , said Uncle Vernon
We should all be in position at eight o'clock
Petunia , you will be - ? In the lounge , said Aunt Petunia promptly , waiting to welcome them graciously to our home
And Dudley ? I 'll be waiting to open the door
Dudley put on a foul , simpering smile
May I take your coats , Mr
Mason ? They 'll love him cried Aunt Petunia rapturously
Excellent , Dudley , said Uncle Vernon
Then he rounded on Harry
And you ? I 'll be in my bedroom , making no noise and pretending I 'm not there , said Harry tonelessly
Exactly , said Uncle Vernon nastily
I will lead them into the lounge , introduce you , Petunia , and pour them -drinks
At eight- fifteen -I 'll announce dinner , said Aunt Petunia
And , Dudley , you 'll say -May I take you through to the dining room , Mrs
Mason ? said Dudley , offering his fat arm to an invisible woman
My perfect little gentleman sniffed Aunt Petunia
And you ? said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry
I 'll be in my room , making no noise and pretending I 'm not there , said Harry dully
Now , we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner
Petunia , any ideas ? Vernon tells me you 're a wonderful golfer , Mr
Do tell me where you bought your dress , Mrs
Dudley ? How about -'We had to write an essay about our hero at school , Mr
Mason , and I wrote about you
'This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son , while Harry ducked under the table so they would n't see him laughing
And you , boy ? Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged
I 'll be in my room , making no noise and pretending I 'm not there , he said
Too right , you will , said Uncle Vernon forcefully
The Ma sons do n't know anything about you and it 's going to stay that way
When dinner 's over , you take Mrs
Mason back to the lounge for coffee , Petunia , and I 'll bring the subject around to drills
With any luck , I 'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten
be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to morrow
Harry could n't feel too excited about this
He did n't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive
Right - I 'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me
And you , he snarled at Harry
You stay out of your aunt 's way while she 's cleaning
Harry left through the back door
It was a brilliant , sunny day
He crossed the lawn , slumped down on the garden bench , and sang under his breath : Happy birthday to me
happy birthday to me
No cards , no presents , and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist
He gazed miserably into the hedge
He had never felt so lonely
More than anything else at Hogwarts , more even than playing Quidditch , Harry missed his best friends , Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger
They , however , did n't seem to be missing him at all
Neither of them had written to him all summer , even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay
Countless times , Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig 's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter , but it was n't worth the risk
Underage wizards were n't allowed to use magic outside of school
Harry had n't told theDursleys this ; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick
For the first couple of weeks back , Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him
But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday
What would n't he give now for a message from Hogwarts ? From any witch or wizard ? He 'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy , Draco Malfoy , just to be sure it had n't all been a dream
Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun
At the very end of last term , Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself
Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self , but he was still terrifying , still cunning , still determined to regain power
Harry had slipped through Voldemort 's clutches for a second time , but it had been a narrow escape , and even now , weeks later , Harry kept waking in the night , drenched in cold sweat , wondering where Voldemort was now , remembering his livid face , his wide , mad eyesHarry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench
He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back
Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves
Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn
I know what day it is , sang Dudley , waddling toward him
The huge eyes blinked and vanished
What ? said Harry , not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been
I know what day it is , Dudley repeated , coming right up to him
Well done , said Harry
So you 've finally learned the days of the week
Today 's your birthday , sneered Dudley
How come you have n't got any cards ? Have n't you even got friends at that freak place ? Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school , said Harry coolly
Dudley hitched up his trousers , which were slipping down his fat bottom
Why 're you staring at the hedge ? he said suspiciously
I 'm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire , said Harry
Dudley stumbled backward at once , a look of panic on his fat face
You c-ca n't - Dad told you you 're not to do m-magic - he said he 'll chuck you out of the house - and you have n't got anywhere else to go - you have n't got any friends to take you -Jiggery pokery said Harry in a fierce voice
Hocus pocus squiggly wiggly -MUUUUUUM howled Dudley , tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house
MUUUUM He 's doing you know whatHarry paid dearly for his moment of fun
As neither Dudley northe hedge was in any way hurt , Aunt Petunia knew he had n't really done magic , but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan
Then she gave him work to do , with the promise he would n't eat again until he 'd finished
While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream , Harry cleaned the windows , washed the car , mowed the lawn , trimmed the flowerbeds , pruned and watered the roses , and repainted the garden bench
The sun blazed overhead , burning the back of his neck
Harry knew he should n't have risen to Dudley 's bait , but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself
maybe he did n't have any friends at Hogwarts
Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now , he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds , his back aching , sweat running down his face
It was half past seven , in the evening when at last , exhausted , he heard Aunt Petunia calling him
Get in here And walk on the newspaperHarry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen
On top of the fridge stood tonight 's pudding : a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets
A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven
Eat quickly The Masons will be here soon snapped Aunt Petunia , pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table
She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress
Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper
The moment he had finished , Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate
Upstairs HurryAs he passed the door to the living room , Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jack ets
He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Uncle Vernon 's furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs
Remember , boy - one sound - Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside , closed the door , and turned to collapse on his bed
The trouble was , there was already someone sitting on it
CHAPTER TWoIDOBBY 'S WARNINGarry managed not to shout out , but it was a close thing
The little creature on the bed had large , bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls
Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning
As they stared at each other , Harry heard Dudley 's voice from the hall
May I take your coats , Mr
Mason ? The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long , thin nose touched the carpet
Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase , with rips for arm- and leg-holes
Er - hello , said Harry nervously
Harry Potter said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs
So long has Dobby wanted to meet you , sir
Such an honor it is
Th-thank you , said Harry , edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair , next to Hedwig , who was asleep in her large cage
He wanted to ask , What are you ? but thought it would sound too rude , so instead he said , Who are you ? Dobby , sir
Dobby the house-elf , said the creature
Oh - really ? said Harry
Er - I do n't want to be rude or anything , but - this is n't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom
Aunt Petunias high , false laugh sounded from the living room
The elf hung his head
Not that I 'm not pleased to meet you , said Harry quickly , but , er , is there any particular reason you 're here ? Oh , yes , sir , said Dobby earnestly
Dobby has come to tell you , sir
it is difficult , sir
Dobby wonders where to begin
Sit down , said Harry politely , pointing at the bed
To his horror , the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears
S-sit down he wailed
Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter
I 'm sorry , he whispered , I did n't mean to offend you or anything -Offend Dobby choked the elf
Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard - like an equal-Harry , trying to say Shh and look comforting at the same time , ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing , looking like a large and very ugly doll
At last he managed to control himself , and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration
You ca n't have met many decent wizards , said Harry , trying to cheer him up
Dobby shook his head
Then , without warning , he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window , shouting , Bad Dobby Bad DobbyDo n't - what are you doing ? Harry hissed , springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed - Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage
Dobby had to punish himself , sir , said the elf , who had gone slightly cross-eyed
Dobby almost spoke ill of his family , sir
Your family ? The wizard family Dobby serves , sir
DOBBY 'S is a houseelf - bound to serve one house and one family forever
Do they know you 're here ? asked Harry curiously
Oh , no , sir , no
Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you , sir
Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this
If they ever knew , sir But wo n't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door ? Dobby doubts it , sir
Dobby is always having to punish himself for something , sir
They lets Dobby get on with it , sir
Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments
But why do n't you leave ? Escape ? A house-elf must be set free , sir
And the family will never set Dobby free
Dobby will serve the family until he dies , sir
And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks , he said
This makes the Dursleys sound almost human
Ca n't anyone help you ? Ca n't I ? Almost at once , Harry wished he had n't spoken
Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude
Please , Harry whispered frantically , please be quiet
If the Dursleys hear anything , if they know you 're here -Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby
Dobby has heard of your greatness , sir , but of your goodness , Dobby never knew
Harry , who was feeling distinctly hot in the face , said , Whatever you 've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish
I 'm not even top of my year at Hogwarts ; that 's Hermione , she -But he stopped quickly , because thinking about Hermione was painful
I-Tarry Potter is humble and modest , said Dobby reverently , his orb- like eyes aglow
Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named -Voldemort ? said Harry
Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned , Ah , speak not the name , sir Speak not the nameSorry said Harry quickly
I know lots of people do n't like it
My friend Ron -He stopped again
Thinking about Ron was painful , too
Dobby leaned toward Harry , his eyes wide as headlights
'Dobby heard tell , he said hoarsely , that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time just weeks ago
that Harry Potter escaped Yet again
Harry nodded and Dobby 's eyes suddenly shone with tears
, Ah , sir , he gasped , dabbing his face with a corner of the grubbypillowcase he was wearing
Harry Potter is valiant and bold He has braved so many dangers already But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter , to warn him , even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later
Harry Potter must notgo back to Hogwarts
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon 's voice
W-what ? Harry stammered
But I 've got to go back - term starts on September first
It 's all that 's keeping me going
You do n't know what it 's like here
I do n't belong here
I belong in your world - at Hogwarts
No , no , no , squeaked Dobby , shaking his head so hard his ears flapped
Harry Potter must stay where he is safe
He is too great , too good , to lose
If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts , he will be in mortal danger
Why ? said Harry in surprise
There is a plot , Harry Potter
A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year , whispered Dobby , suddenly trembling all over
Dobby has known it for months , sir
Harry Potter must not put himself in peril
He is too important , sirWhat terrible things ? said Harry at once
Who 's plotting them ? Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall
All right cried Harry , grabbing the elf 's arm to stop him
You ca n't tell me
But why are you warning me ? A sudden , unpleasant thought struck him
Hang on - this has n't got anything to do with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who , has it ? You could just shake or nod , he added hastily as Dobby 's head tilted worryingly close to the wall again
Slowly , Dobby shook his head
Not -not He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named , sir ='But Dobby 's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint
Harry , however , was completely lost
He has n't got a brother , has he ? Dobby shook his head , his eyes wider than ever
Well then , I ca n't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts , said Harry
I mean , there 's Dumbledore , for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is , do n't you ? Dobby bowed his head
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had
Dobby knows it , sir
Dobby has heard Dumbledore 's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength
But , sir - Dobby 's voice dropped to an urgent whisper - there are powers Dumbledore does n't
powers no decent wizard
And before Harry could stop him , Dobby bounded off the bed , seized Harry 's desk lamp , and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps
A sudden silence fell downstairs
Two seconds later Harry , heart thudding madly , heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall , calling , Dudley must have left his television on again , the little tykeQuick In the closet hissed Harry , stuffing Dobby in , shutting the door , and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned
What - the - devil - are - you - doing ? said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth , his face horribly close to Harry 's
You 've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke
One more sound and you 'll wish you 'd never been born , boyHe stomped flat-footed from the room
Shaking , Harry let Dobby out of the closet
See what it 's like here ? he said
See why I 've got to go back to Hogwarts ? It 's the only place I 've got -well , I think I 've got friends
Friends who do n't even write to Harry Potter ? said Dobby slyly
I expect they 've just been - wait a minute , said Harry , frowning
How do you know my friends have n't been writing to me ? Dobby shuffled his feet
Harry Potter must n't be angry with Dobby
Dobby did it for the best - Have you been stopping my letters ? Dobby has them here , sir , said the elf
Stepping nimbly out of Harry 's reach , he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing
Harry could make out Hermione 's neat writing , Ron 's untidy scrawl , and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper , Hagrid
Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry
Harry Potter must n't be angry
if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him
Harry Potter might not want to go back to school , sir
Harry was n't listening
He made a grab for the letters , but Dobby jumped out of reach
Harry Potter will have them , sir , if he gives Dobby his wordthat he will not return to Hogwarts
Ah , sir , this is a danger you must not face Say you wo n't go back , sirNo , said Harry angrily
Give me my friends ' lettersThen Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice , said the elf sadly
Before Harry could move , Dobby had darted to the bedroom door , pulled it open , and sprinted down the stairs
Mouth dry , stomach lurching , Harry sprang after him , trying not to make a sound
He jumped the last six steps , landing catlike on the hall carpet , looking around for Dobby
From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying ,
tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers , Mr
She 's been dying to hear
Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear
Aunt Petunia 's masterpiece of a pudding , the mountain of cream and sugared violets , was floating up near the ceiling
On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby
No , croaked Harry
they 'll kill me
Harry Potter must say he 's not going back to school -Dobby
Say it , sir -I ca n't -Dobby gave him a tragic look
Then Dobby must do it , sir , for Harry Potter 's own good
The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash
Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered
With a crack like a whip , Dobby vanished
There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernonburst into the kitchen to find Harry , rigid with shock , covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunias pudding
At first , it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over
Just our nephew - very disturbedmeeting strangers upsets him , so we kept him upstairs ) Heshooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room , promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Ma sons had left , and handed him a mop
Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry , still shaking , started scrubbing the kitchen clean
Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it had n't been for the owl
Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window , dropped a letter on Mrs
Mason 's head , and swooped out again
Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics
Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes , and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke
Harry stood in the kitchen , clutching the mop for support , as Uncle Vernon advanced on him , a demonic glint in his tiny eyes
Read it he hissed evilly , brandishing the letter the owl had delivered
Go on - read it Harry took it
It did not contain birthday greetings
Potter , We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine
As you know , underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school , and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery , 1875 , Paragraph C )
We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non-magical community Muggles ) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks ' Statute of Secrecy
Enjoy your holidays Yours sincerely , Mafalda HopkirkIMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICEMinistry of MagicHarry looked up from the letter and gulped
You did n't tell us you were n't allowed to use magic outside school , said Uncle Vernon , a mad gleam dancing in his eyes
For got to mention it
Slipped your mind , I daresay
He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog , all his teeth bared
Well , I 've got news for you , boy
I 'm locking you up
You 're never going back to that school
and if you try and magic yourself out - they 'll expel youAnd laughing like a maniac , he dragged Harry back upstairs
Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word
The following morning , he paid a man to fit bars on Harry 's window
He himself fitted a cat- flap in the bedroom door , so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day
They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening
Otherwise , he was locked in his room around the clock
Three days later , the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting , and Harry could n't see any way out of his situation
He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him
What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it ? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low
Now that the Dursleys knew they were n't going to wake up as fruit bats , he had lost his only weapon
Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts , but the way things were going , he 'd probably starve to death anyway
The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared , pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room
Harry , whose insides were aching with hunger , jumped off his bed and seized it
The soup was stone-cold , but he drank half of it in one gulp
Then he crossed the room to Hedwig 's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray
She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust
It 's no good turning your beak up at it - that 's all we 've got , said Harry grimly
He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed , somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup
Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks , what would happen if he did n't turn up at Hogwarts ? Would someone be sent to see why he had n't come back ? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go ? The room was growing dark
Exhausted , stomach rumbling , mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions , Harry fell into an uneasy sleep
He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo , with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage
People goggled through the bars at him as he lay , starving and weak , on a bed of straw
He saw Dobby 's face in the crowd and shouted out , asking for help , but Dobby called , Harry Potter is safe there , sir and vanished
Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage , laughing at him
Stop it , Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head
Leave me alone
cut it out
I 'm trying to sleep
He opened his eyes
Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window
And someone was goggling through the bars at him : a freckle- faced , red-haired , long-nosed someone
Ron Weasley was outside Harry 's window
CHAPTER ThreeTHE BURROWRon
l breathed Harry , creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars
Ron , how did you - What the - ? Harry 's mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him
Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car , which was parked in midair Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George , Ron 's elder twin brothers
All right , Harry ? asked George
What 's been going on ? said Ron
Why have n't you been answering my letters ? I 've asked you to stay about twelve times , and then Dad came home and said you 'd got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles -It was n't me - and how did he know ? He works for the Ministry , said Ron
You know we 're not supposed to do spells outside school -You should talk , said Harry , staring at the floating car
Oh , this does n't count , said Ron
We 're only borrowing this
It 's Dad 's , we did n't enchant it
But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with -I told you , I did n't - but it 'll take too long to explain now look , can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and wo n't let me come back , and obviously I ca n't magic myself out , because the Ministry'Il think that 's the second spell I 've done in three days , so -Stop gibbering , said Ron
We 've come to take you home with us
But you ca n't magic me out either -We do n't need to , said Ron , jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning
You forget who I 've got with me
Tie that around the bars , said Fred , throwing the end of a rope to Harry
If the Dursleys wake up , I 'm dead , said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car
Do n't worry , said Fred , and stand back
Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig , who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent
The car revved louder and louder and suddenly , with a crunching noise , the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air
Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground
Panting , Ron hoisted them up into the car
Harry listened anxiously , but there was no sound from the Dursleys ' bedroom
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron , Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry 's window
Get in , Ron said
But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick -Where is it ? Locked in the cupboard under the stairs , and I ca n't get out of this room -No problem , said George from the front passenger seat
Out of the way , Harry
Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry 's room
You had to hand it to them , thought Harry , as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock
A lot of wizards think it 's a waste of time , knowing this sort of Muggle trick , said Fred , but we feel they 're skills worth learning , even if they are a bit slow
There was a small click and the door swung open
So - we 'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron , whispered George
Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks , Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing
Harry dashed around his room , collecting his things and passing them out of the window to Ron
Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs
Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough
At last , panting , they reached the landing , then carried the trunk through Harry 's room to the open window
Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron , and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side
Inch by inch , the trunk slid through the window
Uncle Vernon coughed again
A bit more , panted Fred , who was pulling from inside the car
One good push -Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car
Okay , let 's go , George whispered
But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him , followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon 's voice
THAT RUDDY OWLI 've forgotten HedwigHarry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he snatched up Hedwig 's cage , dashed to the window , and passed it out to Ron
He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open
For a split second , Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway ; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry , grabbing him by the ankle
Ron , Fred , and George seized Harry 's arms and pulled as hard as they could
Petunia roared Uncle Vernon
He 's getting away HE 'S GETTING AWAYBut the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry 's leg slid out of Uncle Vernon 's grasp - Harry was in the car - he 'd slammed the door shutPut your foot down , Fred yelled Ron , and the car shot suddenly toward the moon
Harry could n't believe it - he was free
He rolled down thewindow , the night air whipping his hair , and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive
Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and Dudley were all hanging , dumbstruck , out of Harry 's window
See you next summer Harry yelled
The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat , grinning from ear to ear
Let Hedwig out , he told Ron
She can fly behind us
She has n't had a chance to stretch her wings for ages
George handed the hairpin to Ron and , a moment later , Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost
So - what 's the story , Harry ? said Ron impatiently
What 's been happening ? Harry told them all about Dobby , the warning he 'd given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding
There was a long , shocked silence when he had finished
Very fishy , said Fred finally
Definitely dodgy agreed George
So he would n't even tell you who 's supposed to be plotting all this stuff ? I do n't think he could , said Harry
I told you , every time he got close to letting something slip , he started banging his head against the wall
He saw Fred and George look at each other
What , you think he was lying to me ? said Harry
Well , said Fred , put it this way - house-elves have got powerful magic of their own , but they ca n't usually use it without their master 's permission
I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts
Someone 's idea of a joke
Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you ? Yes , said Harry and Ron together , instantly
Draco Malfoy , Harry explained
He hates me
Draco Malfoy ? said George , turning around
Not Lucius Malfoy 's son ? Must be , it 's not a very common name , is it ? said Harry
I 've heard Dad talking about him , said George
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who
And when You-Know-Who disappeared , said Fred , craning around to look at Harry , Lucius Malfoy came back saying he 'd never meant any of it
Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You- Know-Who 's inner circle
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy 's family before , and they did n't surprise him at all
Malfoy made Dudley Dursley looklike a kind , thoughtful , and sensitive boy
I do n't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf saidHarry
Well , whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family , and they 'll be rich , said Fred
Yeah , Mum 's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing , said George
But all we 've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden
House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that ; you would n't catch one in our house
Harry was silent
Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything , his family was rolling in wizard gold ; hecould just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house
Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do
Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously ? I 'm glad we came to get you , anyway , said Ron
I was getting really worried when you did n't answer any of my letters
I thought it was Errol 's fault at first-Who 's Errol ? Our owl
It would n't be the first time he 'd collapsed on a delivery
So then I tried to borrow Hermes -Who ? The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect , said Fred from the front
But Percy would n't lend him to me , said Ron
Said he needed him
Percy 's been acting very oddly this summer , said George , frowning
And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room
I mean , there 's only so many times you can polish a prefect badge
You 're driving too far west , Fred , he added , pointing at a compass on the dashboard
Fred twiddled the steering wheel
So , does your dad know you 've got the car ? said Harry , guessing the answer
Er , no , said Ron , he had to work tonight
Hopefully we 'll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it
What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic , anyway ? He works in the most boring department , said Ron
The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office
The what ? It 's all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made , you know , in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house
Like , last year , some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop
This Muggle woman bought it , took it home , and tried to serve her friends tea in it
It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime for weeks
What happened ? The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose
Dad was going frantic - it 's only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office -and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up -But your dad - this car -Fred laughed
Yeah , Dad 's crazy about everything to do with Muggles ; our shed 's full of Muggle stuff
He takes it apart , puts spells on it , and puts it back together again
If he raided our house he 'd have to put himself under arrest
It drives Mum mad
That 's the main road , said George , peering down through the windshield
We 'll be there in ten minutes
Just as well , it 's getting light
A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east
Fred brought the car lower , and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees
We 're a little way outside the village , said George
Lower and lower went the flying car
The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees
Touchdown said Fred as , with a slight bump , they hit the ground
They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard , and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron 's house
It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen , but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which , Harry reminded himself , it probably was )
Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof
A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read , THE BuRRow
Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron
Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard
It 's not much , said Ron
It 's wonderful , said Harry happily , thinking of Privet Drive
They got out of the car
Now , we 'll go upstairs really quietly , said Fred , and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast Then , Ron , you come bounding downstairs going , ` Mum , look who turned up in the night ' and she 'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car
Right , said Ron
Come on , Harry , I sleep at the - at the topRon had gone a nasty greenish color , his eyes fixed on the house
The other three wheeled around
Weasley was marching across the yard , scattering chickens , and for a short , plump , kind-faced woman , it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger
Ah , said Fred
Oh , dear , said George
Weasley came to a halt in front of them , her hands on her hips , staring from one guilty face to the next
She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket
So , she said
Morning , Mum , said George , in what he clearly thought was a jaunty , winning voice
Have you any idea how worried I 've been ? said Mrs
Weasley in a deadly whisper
Sorry , Mum , but see , we had to -All three of Mrs
Weasley 's sons were taller than she was , but they cowered as her rage broke over them
Beds empty No note Cargone - could have crashed - out of mymind with worry - did you care ? - never , as long as I 've lived - you wait until your father gets home , we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy -Perfect Percy , muttered Fred
YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY 'S BOOK yelled Mrs
Weasley , prodding a finger in Fred 's chest
You could have died , you could have been seen , you could have lost your father his job -It seemed to go on for hours
Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry , who backed away
I 'm very pleased to see you , Harry , dear , she said
Come in and have some breakfast
She turned and walked back into the house and Harry , after a nervous glance at Ron , who nodded encouragingly , followed her
The kitchen was small and rather cramped
There was ascrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle , and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat , looking around
He had never been in a wizard house before
The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all
Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea , Time to feed the chickens , and You 're late
Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece , books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese , Enchantment in Baking , and One Minute Feasts - It 's Magic And unless Harry 's ears were deceiving him , the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was Witching Hour , with the popular singing sorceress , Celestina Warbeck
Weasley was clattering around , cooking breakfast a little haphazardly , throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan
Every now and then she muttered things like do n't know what you were thinking of , and never would have believed it
I do n't blame you , dear , she assured Harry , tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate
Arthur and I have been worried about you , too
Just last night we were saying we 'd come and get you ourselves if you had n't written back to Ron by Friday
But really , she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate ) flying an illegal car halfway across the country - anyone could have seen you -She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink , which began to clean themselves , clinking gently in the background
It was cloudy , Mum said Fred
You keep your mouth closed while you 're eating Mrs
They were starving him , Mum said George
And you said Mrs
Weasley , but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him
At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small , redheaded figure in a long nightdress , who appeared in the kitchen , gave a small squeal , and ran out again
Ginny , said Ron in an undertone to Harry
She 's been talking about you all summer
Yeah , she 'll be wanting your autograph , Harry , Fred said with a grin , but he caught his mother 's eye and bent his face over his plate without another word
Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean , which took a surprisingly short time
Blimey , I 'm tired , yawned Fred , setting down his knife and fork at last
I think I 'll go to bed and -You will not , snapped Mrs
It 's your own fault you 've been up all night
You 're going to de-gnome the garden for me ; they 're getting completely out of hand again -Oh , Mum -And you two , she said , glaring at Ron and Fred
You can go up to bed , dear , she added to Harry
You did n't ask them to fly that wretched car -But Harry , who felt wide awake , said quickly , I 'll help Ron
I 've never seen a de-gnoming -That 's very sweet of you , dear , but it 's dull work , said Mrs
Now , let 's see what Lockhart 's got to say on the subject -And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece
Mum , we know how to de-gnome a garden -Harry looked at the cover of Mrs
Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart 's Guide to Household Pests
There was a big photograph on the front of a very good- IOI ) king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes
As always in the wizarding world , the photograph was moving ; the wizard , who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart , kept winking cheekily up at them all
Weasley beamed down at him
Oh , he is marvelous , she said
He knows his household pests , all right , it 's a wonderful book
Mum fancies him , said Fred , in a very audible whisper
Do n't be so ridiculous , Fred , said Mrs
Weasley , her cheeks rather pink
All right , if you think you know better than Lockhart , you can go and get on with it , and woe betide you if there 's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it
Yawning and grumbling , the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them
The garden was large , and in Harry 's eyes , exactlY what a garden should be
The Dursleys would n't have liked it - there were plenty of weeds , and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls , plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed , and a big green pond full of frogs
Muggles have garden gnomes , too , you know , Harry told Ronthey crossed the lawn
Yeah , I 've seen those things they think are gnomes , said Ron , bent double with his head in a peony bush , like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods
There was a violent scuffling noise , the peony bush shuddered , and Ron straightened up
This is a gnome , he said grimly
Gerroff me Gerroff me squealed the gnome
It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus
It was small and leathery looking , with a large , knobby , bald head exactly like a potato
Ron held it at arm 's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet ; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down
This is what you have to do , he said
He raised the gnome above his head Gerroff me ) and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso
Seeing the shocked look on Harry 's face , Ron added , It does n't hurt them - you 've just got to make them really dizzy so they ca n't find their way back to the gnomeholes
He let go of the gnome 's ankles : It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge
Pitiful , said Fred
I bet I can get mine beyond that stump
Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes
He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge , but the gnome , sensing weakness , sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry 's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off - untilWow , Harry - that must 've been fifty feet
The air was soon thick with flying gnomes
See , they 're not too bright , said George , seizing five or six gnomes at once
The moment they know the de-gnoming 's going on they storm up to have a look
You 'd think they 'd have learned by now just to stay put
Soon , the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line , their little shoulders hunched
They 'll be back , said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field
They love it here
Dad 's too soft with them ; he thinks they 're funny
Just then , the front door slammed
He 's back said George
Dad 's homeThey hurried through the garden and back into the house
Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed
He was a thin man , going bald , but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children 's
He was wearing long green robes , which were dusty and travel-worn
What a night , he mumbled , groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him
Nine And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned
Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed
Find anything , Dad ? said Fred eagerly
All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle , yawned Mr
There was some pretty nasty stuff that was n't my department , though
Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets , but that 's the Committee on Experimental Charms , thank goodness
Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink ? said George
Just Muggle-baiting , sighed Mr
Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it
Of course , it 's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they 'll insist they just keep losing it
Bless them , they 'll go to any lengths to ignore magic , even if it 's staring them in the face
But the things our lot have taken to enchanting , you would n't believe -LIKE CARS , FOR INSTANCE ? Mrs
Weasley had appeared , holding a long poker like a sword
Weasley 's eyes jerked open
He stared guiltily at his wife
C-cars , Molly , dear ? Yes , Arthur , cars , said Mrs
Weasley , her eyes flashing
Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked , while really he was enchanting it to make it fly
Well , dear , I think you 'll find that he would be quite within the law to do that , even if - er - he maybe would have done better to , um , tell his wife the truth
There 's a loophole in the law , you 'll find
As long as he was n't intending to fly the car , the fact that the car could fly would n't -Arthur Weasley , you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted Mrs
Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed And for your information , Harry arrived this morning in the car you were n't intending to flyHarry ? said Mr
Harry who ? He looked around , saw Harry , and jumped
Good lord , is it Harry Potter ? Very pleased to meet you , Ron 's told us so much about -Your sons flew that car to Harry 's house and back last night
What have you got to say about that , eh ? Did you really ? said Mr
Did it go all right ? I - I mean , he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs
Weasley 's eyes , that - that was very wrong , boys - very wrong indeed
Let 's leave them to it , Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs
Weasley swelled like a bullfrog
Come on , I 'll show you my bedroom
They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase , which wound its way , zigzagging upthrough the house
On the third landing , a door stood ajar
Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap
Ginny , said Ron
You do n't know how weird it is for her to be this shy
She never shuts up normally -They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it , saying RONALD 'S ROOM
Harry stepped in , his head almost touching the sloping ceiling , and blinked
It was like walking into a furnace : Nearly everything in Ron 's room seemed to be a violent shade of orange : the bedspread , the walls , even the ceiling
Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards , all wearing bright orange robes , carrying broomsticks , and waving energetically
Your Quidditch team ? said Harry
The Chudley Cannons , said Ron , pointing at the orange bedspread , which was emblazoned with two giant black C 's and a speeding cannonball
Ninth in the league
Ron 's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner , next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs , the Mad Muggle
Ron 's magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill , next to his fat gray rat , Scabbers , who was snoozing in a patch of sun
Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window
In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys ' hedge
Then he turned to look at Ron , who was watching him almost nervously , as though waiting for his opinion
It 's a bit small , said Ron quickly
Not like that room you had with the Muggles
And I 'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic ; he 's always banging on the pipes and groaning
But Harry , grinning widely , said , This is the best house I 've ever been in
Ron 's ears went pink
CHAPTER FOURAT F L 0 V RR 11 H AND BLOTTSife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive
The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered ; the Weasleys ' house burst with the strange and unexpected
Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted , Tuck your shirt in , scruffy The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet , and small explosions from Fred and George 's bedroom were considered perfectly normal
What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron 's , however , was n't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul : It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him
Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal
Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles , asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked
he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone
Ingenious , really , how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic
Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow
He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr
Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table
The moment she saw Harry , Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter
Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room
She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun
Pretending he had n't noticed this , Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs
Weasley offered him
Letters from school , said Mr
Weasley , passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment , addressed in green ink
Dumbledore already knows you 're here , Harry - does n't miss a trick , that man
You two 've got them , too , he added , as Fred and George ambled in , still in their pajamas
For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters
Harry 's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King 's Cross station on September first
There was also a list of the new books he 'd need for the coming year
SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE : The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 2by Miranda GoshawkBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart4 ,3Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy LockhartFred , who had finished his own list , peered over at Harry 's
You 've been told to get all Lockhart 's books , too he said
The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it 's a witch
At this point , Fred caught his mother 's eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade
That lot wo n't come cheap , said George , with a quick look at his parents
Lockhart 's books are really expensive
Well , we 'll manage , said Mrs
Weasley , but she looked worried
I expect we 'll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny 's things secondhand
Oh , are you starting at Hogwarts this year ? Harry asked Ginny
She nodded , blushing to the roots of her flaming hair , and put her elbow in the butter dish
Fortunately no one saw this except Harry , because just then Ron 's elder brother Percy walked in
He was already dressed , his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest
Morning , all , said Percy briskly
He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately , pulling from underneath him a moulting , gray feather duster - at least , that was what Harry thought it was , until he saw that it was breathing
44Errol said Ron , taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing
Finally - he 's got Hermione 's answer
I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys
He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it , but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on the draining board instead , muttering , Pathetic
Then he ripped open Hermione 's letter and read it out loud : ` Dear Ron , and Harry if you 're there , ` I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you did n't do anything illegal to get him out , Ron , because that would get Harry into trouble , too
I 've been really worried and if Harry is all right , will you please let me know at once , but perhaps it would be bet ter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off
' I 'm very busy with schoolwork , of course'- How can she be ? said Ron in horror
We 're on vacation - 'and we 're going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books
Why do n't we meet in Diago n Alley ? ` Let me know what 's happening as soon as you can
Love from Hermione
'Well , that fits in nicely , we can go and get all your things then , too , said Mrs
Weasley , starting to clear the table
What 're you all up to today ? Harry , Ron , Fred , and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned
It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below , meaning that they could practice Quidditch there , as long as they did n't fly too high
4They could n't use real Quidditch balls , which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village ; instead they threw apples for one another to catch
They took turns riding Harry 's Nimbus Two Thousand , which was easily the best broom ; Ron 's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies
Five minutes later they were marching up the hill , broomsticks over their shoulders
They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them , but he had said he was busy
Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far ; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time
Wish I knew what he was up to , said Fred , frowning
He 's not himself
His exam results came the day before you did ; twelve O
s and he hardly gloated at all
Ordinary Wizarding Levels , George explained , seeing Harry 's puzzled look
Bill got twelve , too
If we 're not careful , we 'll have another Head Boy in the family
I do n't think I could stand the shame
Bill was the oldest Weasley brother
He and the next brother , Charlie , had already left Hogwarts
Harry had never met either of them , but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard 's bank , Gringotts
Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year , said George after a while
Five sets of Lockhart books And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything
Harry said nothing
He felt a bit awkward
Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left him
Of course , it was only in the wizarding world that he had money ; you could n't use Galleons , Sickles , and Knuts46in Muggle shops
He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys ; he did n't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold
Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday
After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each , they pulled on their coats and Mrs
Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside
We 're running low , Arthur , she sighed
We 'll have to buy some more today
Ah well , guests first After you , Harry dearAnd she offered him the flowerpot
Harry stared at them all watching him
W-what am I supposed to do ? he stammered
He 's never traveled by Floo powder , said Ron suddenly
Sorry , Harry , I forgot
Never ? said Mr
But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year ? I went on the Underground -Really ? said Mr
Were there escapators ? How exactly -Not now , Arthur , said Mrs
Floo powder 's a lot quicker , dear , but goodness me , if you 've never used it before -He 'll be all right , Mum , said Fred
Harry , watch us first
He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot , stepped up to the fire , and threw the powder into the flames
With a roar , the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred , who stepped right into it , shouted , Diagon Alley and vanished
41You must speak clearly , dear , Mrs
Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot
And be sure to get out at the right grate
The right what ? said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of sight , too
Well , there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from , you know , but as long as you 've spoken clearly -He 'll be fine , Molly , do n't fuss , said Mr
Weasley , helping himself to Floo powder , too
But , dear , if he got lost , how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle ? They would n't mind , Harry reassured her
Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney , do n't worry about that -Well
you go after Arthur , said Mrs
Now , when you get into the fire , say where you 're goingAnd keep your elbows tucked in , Ron advised
And your eyes shut , said Mrs
The soot -Do n't fidget , said Ron
Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace -But do n't panic and get out too early ; wait until you see Fred and George
Trying hard to bear all this in mind , Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire
He took a deep breath , scattered the powder into the flames , and stepped forward ; the fire felt like a warm breeze ; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash
D-Dia-gon Alley , he coughed
48It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain
He seemed to be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening -he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly , still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop , and thenHe fell , face forward , onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap
Dizzy and bruised , covered in soot , he got gingerly to his feet , holding his broken glasses up to his eyes
He was - , cite alone , but where he was , he had no idea
All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large , dimly lit wizard 's shop - but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list
A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion , a bloodstained pack of cards , and a staring glass eye
Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls , an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter , and rusty , spiked instruments hung from the ceiling
Even worse , the dark , narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley
The sooner he got out of here , the better
Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth , Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door , but before he 'd got halfway toward it , two people appeared on the other side of the glass - and one of them was the49very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost , covered in soot , and wearing broken glasses : Draco Malfoy
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left ; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed , leaving a small crack to peer through
Seconds later , a bell clanged , and Malfoy stepped into the shop
The man who followed could only be Draco 's father
He had the same pale , pointed face and identical cold , gray eyes
Malfoy crossed the shop , looking lazily at the items on display , and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying , Touch nothing , Draco
Malfoy , who had reached for the glass eye , said , I thought you were going to buy me a present
I said I would buy you a racing broom , said his father , drumming his fingers on the counter
What 's the good of that if I 'm not on the House team ? said Malfoy , looking sulky and bad-tempered
Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year
Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor
He 's not even that good , it 's just because he 's famous
famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead
Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls
everyone thinks he 's so smart , wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick -You have told me this at least a dozen times already , said Mr
Malfoy , with a quelling look at his son
And I would remind you that it is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter , not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear - ah , Mr
50A stooping man had appeared behind the counter , smoothing his greasy hair back from his face
Malfoy , what a pleasure to see you again , said Mr
Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair
Delighted - and young Master Malfoy , too - charmed
How may I be of assistance ? I must show you , just in today , and very reasonably priced -I 'm not buying today , Mr
Borgin , but selling , said Mr
Selling ? The smile faded slightly from Mr
You have heard , of course , that the Ministry is conducting more raids , said Mr
Malfoy , taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr
Borgin to read
I have a few - ah - items at home that might embarrass me , if the Ministry were to call
Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list
The Ministry would n't presume to trouble you , sir , surely ? Mr
Malfoy 's lip curled
I have not been visited yet
The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect , yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome
There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that flea- bitten , Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind itHarry felt a hot surge of anger
- and as you see , certain of these poisons might make it appear -I understand , sir , of course , said Mr
Let me see
Can I have that ? interrupted Draco , pointing at the withered hand on its cushion
51Ah , the Hand of Glory said Mr
Borgin , abandoning Mr
Malfoy 's list and scurrying over to Draco
Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder Best friend of thieves and plunderers Your son has fine taste , sir
I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer , Borgin , said Mr
Malfoy coldly , and Mr
Borgin said quickly , No offense , sir , no offense meant -Though if his grades do n't pick up , said Mr
Malfoy , more coldly still , that may indeed be all he is fit for -It 's not my fault , retorted Draco
The teachers all have favorites , that Hermione Granger -I would have thought you 'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam , snapped Mr
Ha said Harry under his breath , pleased to see Draco looking both abashed and angry
It 's the same all over , said Mr
Borgin , in his oily voice
Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere -Not with me , said Mr
Malfoy , his long nostrils flaring
No , sir , nor with me , sir , said Mr
Borgin , with a deep bow
In that case , perhaps we can return to my list , said Mr
I am in something of a hurry , Borgin , I have important business elsewhere today -They started to haggle
Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place , examining the objects for sale
Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman 's rope and to read , smirking , the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals , Caution : Do Not Touch
Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date
52Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him
He walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handleDone , said Mr
Malfoy at the counter
Come , Draco -Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away
Good day to you , Mr
I 'll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods
The moment the door had closed , Mr
Borgin dropped his oily manner
Good day yourself , Mister Malfoy , and if the stories are true , you have n't sold me half of what 's hidden in your manor
Muttering darkly , Mr
Borgin disappeared into a back room
Harry waited for a minute in case he came back , then , quietly as he could , slipped out of the cabinet , past the glass cases , and out of the shop door
Clutching his broken glasses to his face , Harry stared around
He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts
The one he 'd just left , Borgin and Burkes , looked like the largest , but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and , two doors down , a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders
Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway , muttering to each other
Feeling jumpy , Harry set off , trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he 'd be able to find a way out of here
An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley
This did n't help , as Harry had never heard of such a place
He supposed he had n't spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashesback in the Weasleys ' fire
Trying to stay calm , he wondered what to do
Not lost are you , my dear ? said a voice in his ear , making him jump
An aged witch stood in front of him , holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails
She leered at him , showing mossy teeth
Harry backed away
I 'm fine , thanks , he said
I 'm just -HARRY What d'yeh think yer doin ' down there ? Harry 's heart leapt
So did the witch ; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid , the Hogwarts gamekeeper , came striding toward them , beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard
Hagrid Harry croaked in relief
I was lost - Floo powder -Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch , knocking the tray right out of her hands
Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight
Harry saw a familiar , snow-white marble building in the distance - Gringotts Bank
Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley
Yer a mess said Hagrid gruffly , brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary
Skulkin ' around Knockturn Alley , I dunno dodgy place , Harry - don ' want no one ter see yeh down there -I realized that , said Harry , ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off again
I told you , I was lost - what were you doing down there , anyway ? 54I was lookin ' fer a Flesh-Eatin ' Slug Repellent , growled Hagrid
They 're ruinin ' the school cabbages
Yer not on yer own ? I 'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated , Harry explained
I 've got to go and find them
They set off together down the street
How come yeh never wrote back ter me ? said Hagrid as Harry jogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride of Hagrid 's enormous boots )
Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys
Lousy Muggles , growled Hagrid
If I'd 've known -Harry Harry Over hereHarry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts
She ran down to meet them , her bushy brown hair flying behind her
What happened to your glasses ? Hello , Hagrid - Oh , it 's wonderful to see you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts , Harry ? As soon as I 've found the Weasleys , said Harry
Yeh wo n't have long ter wait , Hagrid said with a grin
Harry and Hermione looked around : Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron , Fred , George , Percy , and Mr
We hoped you 'd only gone onegrate too far
He mopped his glistening bald patch
Molly'sfrantic - she 's coming now -Where did you come out ? Ron asked
Knockturn Alley , said Hagrid grimly
said Fred and George together
We 've never been allowed in , said Ron enviously
55I should ruddy well think not , growled Hagrid
Weasley now came galloping into view , her handbag swing ing wildly in one hand , Ginny just clinging onto the other
Oh , Harry - oh , my dear - you could have been any where - Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid had n't managed to beat away
Weasley took Harry 's glasses , gave them a tap of his wand , and returned them , good as new
Well , got ta be off , said Hagrid , who was having his hand wrung by Mrs
Weasley Knockturn Alley If you had n't found him , Hagrid )
See yer at Hogwarts And he strode away , head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street
Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes ? Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps
Malfoy and his fa ther
Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything ? said Mr
Weasley sharply behind them
No , he was selling = ' So he 's worried , said Mr
Weasley with grim satisfaction
Oh , I 'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something
You be careful , Arthur , said Mrs
Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door
That family 's trou ble
Do n't go biting off more than you can chew - So you do n't think I 'm a match for Lucius Malfoy ? said Mr
Weasley indignantly , but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione 's parents , who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall , waiting for Hermione to introduce them
,5 sBut you 're Muggles said Mr
We must have a drink What 's that you 've got there ? Oh , you 're changing Muggle money
Molly , look He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr
Meet you back here , Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin
The vaults were reached by means of small , goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the bank 's underground tunnels
Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys ' vault , but felt dreadful , far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley , when it was opened
There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside , and just one gold Galleon
Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag
Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault
He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag
Back outside on the marble steps , they all separated
Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill
Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts , Lee Jordan
Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop
Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink
We 'll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks , said Mrs
Weasley , setting off with Ginny
And not one step down Knockturn Alley she shouted at the twins ' retreating backs
Harry , Ron , and Hermione strolled off along the winding , cobbled street
The bag of gold , silver , and bronze jangling cheerfully57in Harry 's pocket was clamoring to be spent , so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams , which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley , examining the fascinating shop windows
Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Can non robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door
In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop , they met Fred , George , and Lee Jordan , who were stocking up on Dr
Filibuster 's Fabulous Wet-Start , No-Heat Fireworks , and in a tiny junk shop full of bro ken wands , lopsided brass scales , and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy , deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power
` A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers , Ron read aloud off the back cover
That sounds fascinating
Go away , Percy snapped
'Course , he 's very ambitious , Percy , he 's got it all planned out
He wants to be Minister of Magic
Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it
An hour later , they headed for Flourish and Blotts
They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop
As they approached it , they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling out side the doors , trying to get in
The reason for this was proclaimedby a large banner stretched across the upper windows : GILDEROY LOCKHART will be signing copies of his autobiography MAGICAL ME today 12:30 P
to 4:30 P
We can actually meet him Hermione squealed
I mean , he 's written almost the whole booklistThe crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs
A harrassed-looking wizard stood at the door , saying , Calmly , please , ladies
Do n't push , there
mind the books , now
Harry , Ron , and Hermione squeezed inside
A long line wound right to the back of the shop , where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books
They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr
Oh , there you are , good , said Mrs
She sounded breathless and kept patting her hair
We 'll be able to see him in a minute
Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view , seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face , all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd
The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes ; his pointed wizard 's hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair
A short , irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash
Out of the way , there , he snarled at Ron , moving back to get a better shot
This is for the Daily Prophet -Big deal , said Ron , rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it
Gilderoy Lockhart heard him
He looked up
He saw Ron59and then he saw Harry
Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted , It ca n't be Harry Potter ? The crowd parted , whispering excitedly ; Lockhart dived forward , seized Harry 's arm , and pulled him to the front
The crowd burst into applause
Harry 's face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer , who was clicking away madly , wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys
Nice big smile , Harry , said Lockhart , through his own gleaming teeth
Together , you and I are worth the front page
When he finally let go of Harry 's hand , Harry could hardly feel his fingers
He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys , but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side
Ladies and gentlemen , he said loudly , waving for quiet
What an extraordinary moment this is The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I 've been sitting on for some timeWhen young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today , he only wanted to buy my autobiography -which I shall be happy to present him now , free of charge- The crowd applauded again
He had no idea , Lockhart continued , giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose , that he would shortly be getting much , much more than my book , Magical Me
He and his schoolmates will , in fact , be getting the real magical me
Yes , ladies and gentlemen , I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September , I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and WizardryThe crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being60presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart
Staggering slightly under their weight , he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room , where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron
You have these , Harry mumbled to her , tipping the books into the cauldron
I 'll buy my own -Bet you loved that , did n't you , Potter ? said a voice Harry had no trouble recognizing
He straightened up and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy , who was wearing his usual sneer
Famous Harry Potter , said Malfoy
Ca n't even go into a bookshop without making the front page
Leave him alone , he did n't want all that said Ginny
It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry
She was glaring at Malfoy
Potter , you 've got yourself a girlfriend drawled Malfoy
Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over , both clutching stacks of Lockhart 's books
Oh , it 's you , said Ron , looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe
Bet you 're surprised to see Harry here , eh ? Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop , Weasley , retorted Malfoy
I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those
Ron went as red as Ginny
He dropped his books into the cauldron , too , and started toward Malfoy , but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket
Ron said Mr
Weasley , struggling over with Fred and George
What are you doing ? It 's too crowded in here , let 's go outside
61Well , well , well - Arthur Weasley
It was Mr
He stood with his hand on Draco 's shoulder , sneering in just the same way
Lucius , said Mr
Weasley , nodding coldly
Busy time at the Ministry , I hear , said Mr
All those raids
I hope they 're paying you overtime ? He reached into Ginny 's cauldron and extracted , from amid the glossy Lockhart books , a very old , very battered copy of A Beginner 's Guide to Transfiguration
Obviously not , Mr
Dear me , what 's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they do n't even pay you well for it ? Mr
Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny
We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard , Malfoy , he said
Clearly , said Mr
Malfoy , his pale eyes straying to Mr
Granger , who were watching apprehensively
The company you keep , Weasley
and I thought your family could sink no lower ='There was a thud of metal as Ginny 's cauldron went flying ; Mr
Weasley had thrown himself at Mr
Malfoy , knocking him backward into a bookshelf
Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads ; there was a yell of , Get him , Dad from Fred or George ; Mrs
Weasley was shrieking , No , Arthur , no ; the crowd stampeded backward , knocking more shelves over ; Gentlemen , please - please cried the assistant , and then , louder than allBreak it up , there , gents , break it up -62Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books
In an instant he had pulled Mr
Weasley and Mr
Weasley had a cut lip and Mr
Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools
He was still holding Ginny 's old Transfiguration book
He thrust it at her , his eyes glittering with malice
Here , girl - take your book - it 's the best your father can give you - Pulling himself out of Hagrid 's grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop
Yeh should 've ignored him , Arthur , said Hagrid , almost lifting Mr
Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes
Rotten ter the core , the whole family , everyone knows that - no Malfoy 's worth listenin ' ter - bad blood , that 's what it is - come on now - let 's get outta here
The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving , but he barely came up to Hagrid 's waist and seemed to think better of it
They hurried up the street , the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs
Weasley beside herself with fury
A fine example to set for your children
brawling in public
what Gilderoy Lockhart must 've thought -He was pleased , said Fred
Did n't you hear him as we were leaving ? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he 'd be able to work the fight into his report - said it was all publicity -But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron , where Harry , the Weasleys , and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder
They said good-bye to the Grangers , who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side ; Mr
Weasley started to ask63them how bus stops worked , but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs
Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder
It definitely was n't his favorite way to travel
CHAPTER F I v ETHE WHOMPINGWILLOWhe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry 's liking
He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts , but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life
It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive
On their last evening , Mrs
Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry 's favorite things , ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding
Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks ; they fiIled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour
Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed
It took a long while to get started next morning
They were up at dawn , but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do
Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills ; people kept colliding on the stairs , half-dressed with bits of toast in their hands ; and Mr
Weasley nearly broke his neck , tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny 's trunk to the car
Harry could n't see how eight people , six large trunks , two owls , and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia
He had reckoned , of course , without the special features that Mr
Weasley had added
Not a word to Molly , he whispered to Harry as he opened the
trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily
When at last they were all in the car , Mrs
Weasley glanced into the back seat , where Harry , Ron , Fred , George , and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side , and said , Muggles do know more than we give them credit for , do n't they ? She and Ginny got into the front seat , which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench
I mean , you 'd never know it was this roomy from the outside , would you ? Mr
Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard , Harry turning back for a last look at the house
He barely had time to wonder when he 'd see it again when they were back George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks
Five minutes after that , they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick
They had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she 'd left her diary
By the time she had clambered back into the car , they were running very late , and tempers were running high
Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife
Molly , dear -No , Arthur -No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed - that 'd get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds
We 'd be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser -I said no , Arthur , not in broad daylight -They reached King 's Cross at a quarter to eleven
Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station
Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year
The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters , which was n't visible to the Muggle eye
What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten
It did n't hurt , but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing
Percy first , said Mrs
Weasley , looking nervously at the clock overhead , which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier
Percy strode briskly forward and vanished
Weasley went next ; Fred and George followed
I 'll take Ginny and you two come right after us , Mrs
Weasley told Harry and Ron , grabbing Ginny 's hand and setting off
In the blink of an eye they were gone
Let 's go together , we 've only got a minute , Ron said to Harry
Harry made sure that Hedwig 's cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier
He felt61perfectly confident ; this was n't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder
Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier , gathering speed
A few feet away from it , they broke into a run andCRASH
Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward ; Ron 's trunk fell off with a loud thump , Harry was knocked off his feet , and Hedwig 's cage bounced onto the shiny floor , and she rolled away , shrieking indignantly ; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled , What in blazes d'you think you 're doing ? Lost control of the trolley , Harry gasped , clutching his ribs as he got up
Ron ran to pick up Hedwig , who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd
Why ca n't we get through ? Harry hissed to Ron
I dunno -Ron looked wildly around
A dozen curious people were still watching them
We 're going to miss the train , Ron whispered
I do n't understand why the gateway 's sealed itself -Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach
He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might
The metal remained solid
It 's gone , said Ron , sounding stunned
The train 's left
What if Mum and Dad ca n't get back through to us ? Have you got any Muggle money ? 68And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles , out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked
Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand
They heaved their luggage back in , put Hedwig on the back seat , and got into the front
Check that no one 's watching , said Ron , starting the ignition with another tap of his wand
Harry stuck his head out of the window : Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead , but their street was empty
Okay , he said
Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard
The car around them vanished - and so did they
Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him , hear the engine , feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose , but for all he could see , he had become a pair of eyeballs , floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars
Let 's go , said Ron 's voice from his right
And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away , dropping out of sight as the car rose ; in seconds , the whole of London lay , smoky and glittering , below them
Then there was a popping noise and the car , Harry , and Ron reappeared
Uh-oh , said Ron , jabbing at the Invisibility Booster
It 's faulty -Both of them pummeled it
The car vanished
Then it flickered back again
Hold on Ron yelled , and he slammed his foot on the acceler 7 0ator ; they shot straight into the low , woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy
Now what ? said Harry , blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides
We need to see the train to know what direction to go in , said Ron
Dip back down again - quickly -They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats , squinting at the ground
I can see it Harry yelled
Right ahead - thereThe Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake
Due north , said Ron , checking the compass on the dashboard
Okay , we 'll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold onAnd they shot up through the clouds
A minute later , they burst out into a blaze of sunlight
It was a different world
The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud , the sky a bright , endless blue under the blinding white sun
All we 've got to worry about now are airplanes , said Ron
They looked at each other and started to laugh ; for a long time , they could n't stop
It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream
This , thought Harry , was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud , in a car full of hot , bright sunlight , with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment , and the prospect of seeing Fred 's and George 's jealous faces when they 71landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle
They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north , each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view
London was soon far behind them , replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide , purplish moors , a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants , villages with tiny toy churches
Several uneventful hours later , however , Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off
The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink
He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters , but Harry 's T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose
He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below , where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch
Why had n't they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters ? Ca n't be much further , can it ? croaked Ron , hours later still , as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud , staining it a deep pink
Ready for another check on the train ? It was still right below them , winding its way past a snowcapped mountain
It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds
Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again , but as he did so , the engine began to whine
Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances
It 's probably just tired , said Ron
It 's never been this far before
12And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker
Stars were blossoming in the blackness
Harry pulled his sweater back on , try ing to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving fee bly , as though in protest
Not far , said Ron , more to the car than to Harry , not far now , and he patted the dashboard nervously
When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later , they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew
There Harry shouted , making Ron and Hedwig jump
Straight ahead Silhouetted on the dark horizon , high on the cliff over the lake , stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle
But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed
Come on , Ron said cajolingly , giving the steering wheel a lit tle shake , nearly there , come on - The engine groaned
Narrow jets of steam were issuing from un der the hood
Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake
The car gave a nasty wobble
Glancing out of his window , Harry saw the smooth , black , glassy surface of the water , a mile below
Ron 's knuckles were white on the steering wheel
The car wobbled again
Come on , Ron muttered
They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron put his foot down
There was a loud clunk , a splutter , and the engine died com pletely
Uh-oh , said Ron , into the silence
The nose of the car dropped
They were falling , gathering speed , heading straight for the solid castle wall
Noooooo Ron yelled , swinging the steering wheel around ; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc , soaring over the dark greenhouses , then the vegetable patch , and then out over the black lawns , losing altitude all the time
Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocketSTOP STOP he yelled , whacking the dashboard and the windshield , but they were still plummeting , the ground flying up toward themWATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE Harry bellowed , lunging for the steering wheel , but too late
With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood , they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt
Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood ; Hedwig was shrieking in terror ; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry 's head where he had hit the windshield ; and to his right , Ron let out a low , despairing groan
Are you okay ? Harry said urgently
My wand , said Ron , in a shaky voice
Look at my wand -It had snapped , almost in two ; the tip was dangling limply , held on by a few splinters
Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they 'd be able to mend it up at the school , but he never even got started
At that very moment , something hit his side of the car with the force of a Y4 charging bull , sending him lurching sideways into Ron , just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof
What 's happen - ? Ron gasped , staring through the windshield , and Harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it
The tree they had hit was attacking them
Its trunk was bent almost double , and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach
Aaargh said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door ; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof , which seemed to be cavingRun for it Ron shouted , throwing his full weight against his door , but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry 's lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch
We 're done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged , but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted
Reverse Harry yelled , and the car shot backward ; the tree was still trying to hit them ; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up , lashing out at them as they sped out of reach
That , panted Ron , was close
Well done , car - The car , however , had reached the end of its tether
With two sharp clunks , the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways : Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground
Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk ; Hedwig 's cage flew through the air and burst open ; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castleY5without a backward look
Then , dented , scratched , and steaming , the car rumbled off into the darkness , its rear lights blazing angrily
Come back Ron yelled after it , brandishing his broken wand
Dad 'll kill meBut the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust
Can you believe our luck ? said Ron miserably , bending down to pick up Scabbers
Of all the trees we could 've hit , we had to get one that hits back
He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree , which was still flailing its branches threateningly
Come on , said Harry wearily , we 'd better get up to the school
It was n't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured
Stiff , cold , and bruised , they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope , toward the great oak front doors
I think the feast 's already started , said Ron , dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window
Hey - Harry - come and look - it 's the SortingHarry hurried over and , together , he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall
Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long , crowded tables , making the golden plates and goblets sparkle
Overhead , the bewitched ceiling , which always mirrored the sky outside , sparkled with stars
Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats , Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years fiIing into the Hall
Ginny 76was among them , easily visible because of her vivid Weasley ha-ir
Meanwhile , Professor McGonagall , a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun , was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers
Every year , this aged old hat , patched , frayed , and dirty , sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin )
Harry well remembered putting it on , exactly one year ago , and waiting , petrified , for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear
For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin , the house that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -but he had ended up in Gryffindor , along with Ron , Hermione , and the rest of the Weasleys
Last term , Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship , beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years
A very small , mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head
Harry 's eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore , the headmaster , sat watching the Sorting from the staff table , his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight
Several seats along , Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart , dressed in robes of aquamarine
And there at the end was Hagrid , huge and hairy , drinking deeply from his goblet
Harry muttered to Ron
There 's an empty chair at the staff table
Where 's Snape ? Professor Severus Snape was Harry 's least favorite teacher
Harry also happened to be Snape 's least favorite student
Cruel , sarcastic , and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house Slytherin ) , Snape taught Potions
Maybe he 's ill said Ron hopefully
Maybe he 's left , said Ha-rry , because he missed out on the Defense Against Dark Arts job againOr he might have been sacked said Ron enthusiastically
I mean , everyone hates him -Or maybe , said a very cold voice right behind them , he 's waiting to hear why you two did n't arrive on the school train
Harry spun around
There , his black robes rippling in a cold breeze , stood Severus Snape
He was a thin man with sallow skin , a hooked nose , and greasy , shoulder-length black hair , and at this moment , he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble
Follow me , said Snape
Not daring even to look at each other , Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast , echoing entrance hall , which was lit with flaming torches
A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall , but Snape led them away from the warmth and light , down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons
In he said , opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing
They entered Snape 's office , shivering
The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass ) ars , in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry did n't really want to know the name of at the moment
The fireplace was dark and empty
Snape closed the door and turned to look at them
So , he said softly , the train is n't good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley
Wanted to arrive with a bang , did we , boys ? No , sir , it was the barrier at King 's Cross , it -78Silence said Snape coldly
What have you done with the car ? Ron gulped
This was n't the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds
But a moment later , he un derstood , as Snape unrolled today 's issue of the Evening Prophet
You were seen , he hissed , showing them the headline : FLY ING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES
He began to read aloud : Two Muggles in London , convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower
at noon in Norfolk , Mrs
Hetty Bayliss , while hanging out her washing
Angus Fleet , of Peebles , reported to police
Six or seven Muggles in all
I be lieve your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office ? he said , looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily
his own son
Harry felt as though he 'd just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree 's larger branches
If anyone found out Mr
Weasley had bewitched the car
he had n't thought of that
I noticed , in my search of the park , that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow , Snape went on
That tree did more damage to us than we - Ron blurted out
Silence snapped Snape again
Most unfortunately , you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me
I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power
You will wait here
Harry and Ron stared at each other , white-faced
Harry did n't feel hungry any more
He now felt extremely sick
He tried not to look at a large , slimy something suspended in green liquid on ashelf behind Snape 's desk
If Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall , head of Gryffindor House , they were hardly any better off
She might be fairer than Snape , but she was still extremely strict
Ten minutes later , Snape returned , and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him
Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions , but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go , or he had never seen her this angry before
She raised her wand the moment she entered ; Harry and Ron both flinched , but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace , where flames suddenly erupted
Sit , she said , and they both backed into chairs by the fire
Explain , she said , her glasses glinting ominously
Ron launched into the story , starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through
-so we had no choice , Professor , we could n't get on the train
Why did n't you send us a letter by owl ? I believe you have an owl ? Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry
Harry gaped at her
Now she said it , that seemed the obvious thing to have done
I - I did n't think -That , said Professor McGonagall , is obvious
There was a knock on the office door and Snape , now looking happier than ever , opened it
There stood the headmaster , Professor Dumbledore
Harry 's whole body went numb
Dumbledore was looking unusually grave
He stared down his very crooked nose at them , and80Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow
There was a long silence
Then Dumbledore said , Please explain why you did this
It would have been better if he had shouted
Harry hated the disappointment in his voice
For some reason , he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes , and spoke instead to his knees
He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr
Weasley owned the bewitched car , making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station
He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once , but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car
When Harry had finished , he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles
We 'll go and get our stuff , said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice
What are you talking about , Weasley ? barked Professor McGonagall
Well , you 're expelling us , are n't you ? said Ron
Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore
Not today , Mr
Weasley , said Dumbledore
But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done
I will be writing to both your families tonight
I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again , I will have no choice but to expel you
Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled
He cleared his throat and said , Professor Dumbledore , these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry , caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature - 8iIt will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys ' punishments , Severus , said Dumbledore calmly
They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility
He turned to Professor McGonagall
I must go back to the feast , Minerva , I 've got to give out a few notices
Come , Severus , there 's a delicious-looking cus tard tart I want to sample - Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office , leaving them alone with Pro fessor McGonagall , who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle
You 'd better get along to the hospital wing , Weasley , you 're bleeding
Not much , said Ron , hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve
Professor , I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted - The Sorting Ceremony is over , said Professor McGonagall
Your sister is also in Gryffindor
Oh , good , said Ron
And speaking of Gryffindor - Professor McGonagall said sharply , but Harry cut in : Professor , when we took the car , term had n't started , so - so Gryffindor should n't really have points taken from it - should it ? he finished , watching her anxiously
Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look , but he was sure she had almost smiled
Her mouth looked less thin , anyway
I will not take any points from Gryffindor , she said , and Harry 's heart lightened considerably
But you will both get a de tention
It was better than Harry had expected
As for Dumbledore 's writing to the Dursleys , that was nothing
Harry knew perfectly well they 'd just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow had n't squashed him flat
82Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape 's desk
A large plate of sandwiches , two silver goblets , and a jug of-iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop
You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory , she said
I must also return to the feast
When the door had closed behind her , Ron let out a long , low whistle
I thought we 'd had it , he said , grabbing a sandwich
So did I , said Harry , taking one , too
Can you believe our luck , though ? said Ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham
Fred and George must 've flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them
He swallowed and took another huge bite
Why could n't we get through the barrier ? Harry shrugged
We 'll have to watch our step from now on , though , he said , taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice
Wish we could 've gone up to the feast
She did n't want us showing off , said Ron sagely
Does n't want people to think it 's clever , arriving by flying car
When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could the plate kept refilling itself ) they rose and left the office , treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower
The castle was quiet ; it seemed that the feast was over
They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor , and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs , until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden , behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress
Password ? she said as they approached
Er - said Harry
They did n't know the new year 's password , not having met a Gryffindor prefect yet , but help came almost immediately ; they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward them
There you are Where have you been ? The most ridiculous rumors - someone said you 'd been expelled for crashing a flying carWell , we have n't been expelled , Harry assured her
You 're not telling me you did fly here ? said Hermione , sounding almost as severe as Professor McGonagall
Skip the lecture , said Ron impatiently , and tell us the new password
It 's ` wattlebird , ' said Hermione impatiently , but that 's not the point - Her words were cut short , however , as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping
It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake , packed into the circular common room , standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs , waiting for them to arrive
Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside , leaving Hermione to scramble in after then-t
Brilliant yelled Lee Jordan
Inspired What an entrance Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow , people 'll be talking about that one for years -Good for you , said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to ; someone was patting him on the back as though he 'd just won a marathon ; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together , Why could n't we 've come in the car , eh ? 84Ron was scarlet in the face , grinning embarrassedly , but Harry could see one person who did n't look happy at all
Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years , and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off
Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy 's direction
Ron got the point at once
Got to get upstairs - bit tired , he said , and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room , which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories
'Night , Harry called back to Hermione , who was wearing a scowl just like Percy 's
They managed to get to the other side of the common room , still having their backs slapped , and gained the peace of the staircase
They hurried up it , right to the top , and at last reached the door of their old dormitory , which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS
They entered the familiar , circular room , with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high , narrow windows
Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds
Ron grinned guiltily at Harry
I know I shouldn't 've enjoyed that or anything , but ='The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys , Seamus Finnigan , Dean Thomas , and Neville Longbottom
Unbelievable beamed Seamus
Cool , said Dean
Amazing , said Neville , awestruck
Harry could n't help it
He grinned , too
85 CHAPTER SixGILDEROY LOCKHARThe next day , however , Harry barely grinned once
Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall
The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge , plates of kippers , mountains of toast , and dishes of eggs and bacon , beneath the enchanted ceiling today , a dull , cloudy gray )
Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione , who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug
There was a slight stiffness in the way she said Morning , which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived
Neville Longbottom , on the other hand , greeted them cheerfully
Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met
Mail 's due any minute - I think Gran 's sending a few things I forgot
Harry had only just started his porridge when , sure enough , there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls86streamed in , circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd
A big , lumpy package bounced off Neville 's head and , a second later , something large and gray fell into Hermione 's jug , spraying them all with milk and feathers
Enrol said Ron , pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet
Errol slumped , unconscious , onto the table , his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak
Oh , no - Ron gasped
It 's all right , he 's still alive , said Hermione , prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger
It 's not that - it 's that
Ron was pointing at the red envelope
It looked quite ordinary to Harry , but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode
What 's the matter ? said Harry
She 's - she 's sent me a Howler , said Ron faintly
You 'd better open it , Ron , said Neville in a timid whisper
It 'll be worse if you do n't My gran sent me one once , and I ignored it and - he gulped - it was horrible
Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope
What 's a Howler ? he said
But Ron 's whole attention was fixed on the letter , which had begun to smoke at the corners
Open it , Neville urged
It 'll all be over in a few minutes -Ron stretched out a shaking hand , eased the envelope from Errol 's beak , and slit it open
Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears
A split second later , Harry knew why
He thought for a moment it had exploded ; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall , shaking dust from the ceiling
STEALING THE CAR , I WOULD N'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY 'D EXPELLED YOU , YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU , I DO N'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE -Mrs
Weasleys yells , a hundred times louder than usual , made the plates and spoons rattle on the table , and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls
People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler , and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen
- LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT , I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME , WE DID N'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS , YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED -Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up
He tried very hard to look as though he could n't hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb
-ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER 'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK , IT 'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE 'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME
A ringing silence fell
The red envelope , which had dropped from Ron 's hand , burst into flames and curled into ashes
Harry and Ron sat stunned , as though a tidal wave had just passed over them
A few people laughed and , gradually , a babble of talk broke out again
Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron 's head
88Well , I do n't know what you expected , Ron , but you -Do n't tell me I deserved it , snapped Ron
Harry pushed his porridge away
His insides were burning with guilt
Weasley was facing an inquiry at work
After all Mr
Weasley had done for him over the summer
But he had no time to dwell on this ; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table , handing out course schedules
Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufepuffs first
Harry , Ron , and Hermione left the castle together , crossed the vegetable patch , and made for the greenhouses , where the magical plants were kept
At least the Howler had done one good thing : Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again
As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside , waiting for Professor Sprout
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn , accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart
Professor Sprout 's arms were full of bandages , and with another twinge of guilt , Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance , several of its branches now in slings
Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair ; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint
Gilderoy Lockhart , however , was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise , his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming
Oh , hello there he called , beaming around at the assembled89students
Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow But I do n't want you running away with the idea that I 'm better at Herbology than she is I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels
Greenhouse three today , chaps said Professor Sprout , who was looking distinctly disgruntled , not at all her usual cheerful self
There was a murmur of interest
They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants
Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door
Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant , umbrella- sized flowers dangling from the ceiling
He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart 's hand shot out
Harry I 've been wanting a word - you do n't mind if he 's a couple of minutes late , do you , Professor Sprout ? Judging by Professor Sprout 's scowl , she did mind , but Lockhart said , That 's the ticket , and closed the greenhouse door in her face
Harry , said Lockhart , his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head
Harry , Harry , Harry
Completely nonplussed , Harry said nothing
When I heard -well , of course , it was all my fault
Could have kicked myself
Harry had no idea what he was talking about
He was about to say so when Lockhart went on , Do n't know when I 've been more shocked
Flying a car to Hogwarts Well , of course , I knew at once why you 'd done it
Stood out a mile
Harry , Harry , Harry
It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he was n't talking
90Gave you a taste for publicity , did n't I ? said Lockhart
Gave you the bug
You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you could n't wait to do it again
Oh , no , Professor , see - Harry , Harry , Harry , said Lockhart , reaching out and grasping his shoulder
Natural to want a bit more once you 've had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that , be cause it was bound to go to your head - but see here , young man , you ca n't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed
Just calm down , all right ? Plenty of time for all that when you 're older
Yes , yes , I know what you 're thinking 'It 's all right for him , he 's an in ternationally famous wizard already ' But when I was twelve , I was just as much of a nobody as you are now
In fact , Id say I was even more of a nobody I mean , a few people have heard of you , have n't they ? All that business with He-\o-Must-Not-Be-Named He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry 's forehead
I know , I know - it 's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly 's Most Charming-Smile Award five times in a row , as I have - but it 's a start , Harry , it 's a start
He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off
Harry stood stunned for a few seconds , then , remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse , he opened the door and slid inside
Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the cen ter of the greenhouse
About twenty pairs of different-colored ear muffs were lying on the bench
When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione , she said , We 'll be repotting Man drakes today
Now , who can tell me the properties of the Man drake ? To nobody 's surprise , Hermione 's hand was first into the air
s1Mandrake , or Mandragora , is a powerful restorative , said Hermione , sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook
It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state
Ten points to Gryffindor , said Professor Sprout
The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes
It is also , however , dangerous
Who can tell me why ? Hermione 's hand narrowly missed Harry 's glasses as it shot up again
The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it , she said promptly
Take another ten points , said Professor Sprout
Now , the Mandrakes we have here are still very young
She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke , and everyone shuffled forward for a better look
A hundred or so tufty little plants , purplish green in color , were growing there in rows
They looked quite unremarkable to Harry , who did n't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the cry of the Mandrake
Everyone take a pair of earmuffs , said Professor Sprout
There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that was n't pink and fluffy
When I tell you to put them on , make sure your ears are completely covered , said Professor Sprout
When it is safe to remove them , I will give you the thumbs-up
Right - earmuffs on
Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears
They shut out sound completely
Professor Sprout put the pink , fluffy pair over her own ears , rolled up the sleeves of her robes , grasped one of the tufty plants firmly , and pulled hard
92Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear
Instead of roots , a small , muddy , and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth
The leaves were growing right out of his head
He had pale green , mottled skin , and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs
Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it , burying him in dark , damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible
Professor Sprout dusted off her hands , gave them all the thumbs-up , and removed her own earmuffs
As our Mandrakes are only seedlings , their cries wo n't kill yet , she said calmly as though she 'd just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia
However , they will knock you out for several hours , and as I 'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back , make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work
I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up
Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the sacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula , it 's teething
She gave a sharp slap to a spiky , dark red plant as she spoke , making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder
Harry , Ron , and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to
Justin Finch-Fletchley , he said brightly , shaking Harry by the hand
Know who you are , of course , the famous Harry Potter
And you 're Hermione Granger - always top in everything 9Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too ) - and Ron Weasley
Was n't that your flying car ? Ron did n't smile
The Howler was obviously still on his mind
That Lockhart 's something , is n't he ? said Justin happily as they began fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost
Awfully brave chap
Have you read his books ? Id have died of fear if Id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf , but he stayed cool and - zap - just fantastic
My name was down for Eton , you know
I ca n't tell you how glad I am I came here instead
Of course , Mother was slightly disappointed , but since I made her read Lockhart 's books I think she 's begun to see how useful it 'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family
After that they did n't have much chance to talk
Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes
Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy , but it was n't
The Mandrakes did n't like coming out of the earth , but did n't seem to want to go back into it either
They squirmed , kicked , flailed their sharp little fists , and gnashed their teeth ; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot
By the end of the class , Harry , like everyone else , was sweaty , aching , and covered in earth
Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration
Professor McGonagall 's classes were always hard work , but today was especially difficult
Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer
He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button , but all he managed 94to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand
Ron was having far worse problems
He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape , but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair
It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments , and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs
Unable to see what he was doing , Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one
Professor McGonagall was n't pleased
Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell
His brain felt like a wrung sponge
Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except him and Ron , who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk
Stupid - useless - thing -Write home for another one , Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker
Oh , yeah , and get another Howler back , said Ron , stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag
` It 's your own fault your wand got snapped - 'They went down to lunch , where Ron 's mood was not improved by Hermione 's showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in Transfiguration
What 've we got this afternoon ? said Harry , hastily changing the subject
Defense Against the Dark Arts , said Hermione at once
Why , demanded Ron , seizing her schedule , have you outlined all Lockhart 's lessons in little hearts ? Hermione snatched the schedule back , blushing furiously
95 They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard
Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again
Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched
Looking up , he saw the very small , mousy-haired boy he 'd seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed
He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera , and the moment Harry looked at him , he went bright red
All right , Harry ? I 'm -I 'm Colin Creevey , he said breathlessly , taking a tentative step forward
I 'm in Gryffindor , too
D'you think - would it be all right if - can I have a picture ? he said , raising the camera hopefully
A picture ? Harry repeated blankly
So I can prove I 've met you , said Colin Creevey eagerly , edging further forward
I know all about you
Everyone 's told me
About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you 've still got a lightning scar on your forehead his eyes raked Harry 's hairline ) and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion , the pictures 'll move
Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said , It 's amazing here , is n't it ? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts
My dad 's a milkman , he could n't believe it either
So I 'm taking loads of pictures to send home to him
And it 'd be really good if I had one of you - he looked imploringly at Harry - maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you ? And then , could you sign it ? 96Signed photos ? You 're giving out signed photos , Potter ? Loud and scathing , Draco Malfoy 's voice echoed around the courtyard
He had stopped right behind Colin , flanked , as he always was at Hogwarts , by his large and thuggish cronies , Crabbe and Goyle
Everyone line up Malfoy roared to the crowd
Harry Potter 's giving out signed photosNo , I 'm not , said Harry angrily , his fists clenching
Shut up , Malfoy
You 're just jealous , piped up Colin , whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe 's neck
` jealous ? said Malfoy , who did n't need to shout anymore : half the courtyard was listening in
Of what ? I do n't want a foul scar right across my head , thanks
I do n't think getting your head cut open makes you that special , myself
Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly
Eat slugs , Malfoy , said Ron angrily
Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way
Be careful , Weasley , sneered Malfoy
You do n't want to start any trouble or your Mommy 'll have to come and take you away from school
He put on a shrill , piercing voice
Ifyou put another toe out of line ' - A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this
Weasley would like a signed photo , Potter , smirked Malfoy
It 'd be worth more than his family 's whole house -Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand , but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered , Look outWhat 's all this , what 's all this ? Gilderoy Lockhart was striding 97toward them , his turquoise robes swirling behind him
Who 's giv ing out signed photos ? Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially , Should n't have asked We meet again , Harry Pinned to Lockhart 's side and burning with humiliation , Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd
Come on then , Mr
Creevey , said Lockhart , beaming at Colin
A double portrait , ca n't do better than that , and we 'll both sign it for you
Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them , signaling the start of afternoon classes
Off you go , move along there , Lockhart called to the crowd , and he set off back to the castle with Harry , who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell , still clasped to his side
A word to the wise , Harry , said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door
I covered up for you back there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me , too , your schoolmates wo n't think you 're setting yourself up so much
Deaf to Harry 's stammers , Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase
Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career is n't sensible - looks a tad bigheaded , Harry , to be frank
There may well come a time when , like me , you 'll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go , but - he gave a little chor tle - I do n't think you 're quite there yet
They had reached Lockhart 's classroom and he let Harry go at98last
Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class , where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart 's books in front of him , so that he could avoid looking at the real thing
The rest of the class came clattering in , and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry
You could 've fried an egg on your face said Ron
You 'd better hope Creevey does n't meet Ginny , or they 'll be starting a Harry Potter fan club
Shut up , snapped Harry
The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase Harry Potter fan club
When the whole class was seated , Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell
He reached forward , picked up Neville Longbottom 's copy of Travels with Trolls , and held it up to show his own , winking portrait on the front
Me , he said , pointing at it and winking as well
Gilderoy Lockhart , Order of Merlin , Third Class , Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League , and five-time winner of Witch Weekly 's Most- Charming-Smile Award - but I do n't talk about that
I did n't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at herHe waited for them to laugh ; a few people smiled weakly
I see you 've all bought a complete set of my books -well done
I thought we 'd start today with a little quiz
Nothing to worry aboutjust to check how well you 've read them , how much you 've taken in -When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said , You have thirty minutes - start - nowHarry looked down at his paper and read:1
What is Gilderoy Lockhart 's favorite color ? 2
What is Gilderoy Lockhart 's secret ambition ? 3
What , in your opinion , is Gilderoy Lockhart 's greatest achievement to date ? On and on it went , over three sides of paper , right down to:4
When is Gilderoy Lockhart 's birthday , and what would his ideal gift be ? Half an hour later , Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class
Tut , tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac
I say so in Year with the Yeti
And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples - though I would n't say no to a large bottle of Ogdeds Old FirewhiskyHe gave them another roguish wink
Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face ; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas , who were sitting in front , were shaking with silent laughter
Hermione , on the other hand , was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name
but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good girl In fact - he flipped her paper over - full marks Where is Miss Hermione Granger ? 100Hermione raised a trembling hand
Excellent beamed Lockhart
Quite excellent Take ten points for Gryffindor And so - to business -He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large , covered cage onto it
Now - be warned It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room
Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here
All I ask is that you remain calm
In spite of himself , Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage
Lockhart placed a hand on the cover
Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now
Neville was cowering in his front row seat
I must ask you not to scream , said Lockhart in a low voice
It might provoke them
As the whole class held its breath , Lockhart whipped off the cover
Yes , he said dramatically
Freshly caught Cornish pixies
Seamus Finnigan could n't control himself
He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart could n't mistake for a scream of terror
Yes ? He smiled at Seamus
Well , they 're not - they 're not very - dangerous , are they ? Seamus choked
Do n't be so sure said Lockhart , waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus
Devilish tricky little blighters they can beThe pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high , with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing
The moment the cover had been removed , they101had started jabbering and rocketing around , rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them
Right , then , Lockhart said loudly
Let 's see what you make of them And he opened the cage
It was pandemonium
The pixies shot in every direction like rockets
Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air
Several shot straight through the window , showering the back row with broken glass
The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino
They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them , shredded books and papers , tore pictures from the walls , up-ended the waste basket , grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window ; within minutes , half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling
Come on now - round them up , round them up , they 're only pixies , Lockhart shouted
He rolled up his sleeves , brandished his wand , and bellowed , Peskipiksi PesternomiIt had absolutely no effect ; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window , too
Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk , narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville , who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way
The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit
In the relative calm that followed , Lockhart straightened up , caught sight of Harry , Ron , and Hermione , who were almost at the door , and said , Well , I 'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage
He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him
102Can you believe him ? roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear
He just wants to give us some hands-on experience , said Hermione , immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage
Hands on ? said Harry , who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out
Hermione , he did n't have a clue what he was doing -Rubbish , said Hermione
You 've read his books - look at all those amazing things he 's done -He says he 's done , Ron muttered
arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor
Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey , who seemed to have memorized Harry 's schedule
Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say , All right , Harry ? six or seven times a day and hear , Hello , Colin , back , however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it
Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron 's wand was still malfunctioning , surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron 's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes , creating a large , throbbing green boil where it had struck
So with one thing and another , Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend
He , Ron , and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning
Harry , however , was shaken awake several hours earlier104than he would have liked by Oliver Wood , Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team
Whassamatter ? said Harry groggily
Quidditch practice said Wood
Come onHarry squinted at the window
There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky
Now that he was awake , he could n't understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making
Oliver , Harry croaked
It 's the crack of dawn
Exactly , said Wood
He was a tall and burly sixth year and , at the moment , his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm
It 's part of our new training program
Come on , grab your broom , and let 's go , said Wood heartily
None of the other teams have started training yet ; we 're going to be first off the mark this year -Yawning and shivering slightly , Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes
Good man , said Wood
Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes
When he 'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth , Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he 'd gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room , his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder
He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase , his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand
I heard someone saying your name on the stairs , Harry Look what I 've got here I 've had it developed , I wanted to show you -105Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose
A moving , black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own
He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view
As Harry watched , Lockhart gave up and slumped , panting , against the white edge of the picture
Will you sign it ? said Colin eagerly
No , said Harry flatly , glancing around to check that the room was really deserted
Sorry , Colin , I 'm in a hurry - Quidditch practice -He climbed through the portrait hole
Oh , wow Wait for me I 've never watched a Quidditch game beforeColin scrambled through the hole after him
It 'll be really boring , Harry said quickly , but Colin ignored him , his face shining with excitement
You were the youngest House player in a hundred years , were n't you , Harry ? Were n't you ? said Colin , trotting alongside him
You must be brilliant
I 've never flown
Is it easy ? Is that your own broom ? Is that the best one there is ? Harry did n't know how to get rid of him
It was like having an extremely talkative shadow
I do n't really understand Quidditch , said Colin breathlessly
Is it true there are four balls ? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms ? Yes , said Harry heavily , resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch
They 're called Bludgers
There are two Beaters106on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side
Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters
And what are the other balls for ? Colin asked , tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry
Well , the Quafe - that 's the biggish red one - is the one that scores goals
Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch - they 're three long poles with hoops on the end
And the fourth ball -- is the Golden Snitch , said Harry , and it 's very small , very fast , and difficult to catch
But that 's what the Seeker 's got to do , because a game of Quidditch does n't end until the Snitch has been caught
And whichever team 's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points
And you 're the Gryffindor Seeker , are n't you ? said Colin in awe
Yes , said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew- drenched grass
And there 's the Keeper , too
He guards the goal posts
That 's it , really
But Colin did n't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field , and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms ; Colin called after him in a piping voice , I 'll go and get a good seat , Harry and hurried off to the stands
The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room
Wood was the only person who looked truly awake
Fred and George Weasley were sitting , puffy-eyed and touslehaired , next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet , who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her
Her fellow Chasers , Katie107Bell and Angelina Johnson , were yawning side by side opposite them
There you are , Harry , what kept you ? said Wood briskly
Now , I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field , because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program , which I really think will make all the difference
Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field , on which were drawn many lines , arrows , and crosses in differentcolored inks
He took out his wand , tapped the board , and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars
As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics , Fred Weasley 's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet 's shoulder and he began to snore
The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain , but there was another board under that , and a third under that one
Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on
So , said Wood , at long last , jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle
Is that clear ? Any questions ? I 've got a question , Oliver , said George , who had woken with a start
Why could n't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake ? Wood was n't pleased
Now , listen here , you lot , he said , glowering at them all
We should have won the Quidditch cup last year
We 're easily the best team
But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control - 108Harry shifted guiltily in his seat
He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year , meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years
Wood took a moment to regain control of himself
Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him
So this year , we train harder than ever before
Okay , let 's go and put our new theories into practice Wood shouted , seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms
Stifflegged and still yawning , his team followed
They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now , although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium
As Harry walked onto the field , he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands
Are n't you finished yet ? called Ron incredulously
Have n't even started , said Harry , looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall
Wood 's been teaching us new moves
He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground , soaring up into the air
The cool morning air whipped his face , waking him far more effectively than Wood 's long talk
It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field
He soared right around the stadium at full speed , racing Fred and George
What 's that funny clicking noise ? called Fred as they hurtled around the corner
Harry looked into the stands
Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats , his camera raised , taking picture after picture , the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium
io9Look this way , Harry This way he cried shrilly
Who 's that ? said Fred
No idea , Harry lied , putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin
What 's going on ? said Wood , frowning , as he skimmed through the air toward them
Why 's that first year taking pictures ? I do n't like it
He could be a Slytherin spy , trying to find out about our new training program
He 's in Gryffindor , said Harry quickly
And the Slytherins do n't need a spy , Oliver , said George
What makes you say that ? said Wood testily
Because they 're here in person , said George , pointing
Several people in green robes were walking onto the field , broomsticks in their hands
I do n't believe it Wood hissed in outrage
I booked the field for today We 'll see about thisWood shot toward the ground , landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger , staggering slightly as he dismounted
Harry , Fred , and George followed
Flint Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain
This is our practice time We got up specially You can clear off nowMarcus Flint was even larger than Wood
He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied , Plenty of room for all of us , Wood
Angelina , Alicia , and Katie had come over , too
There were no girls on the Slytherin team , who stood shoulder to shoulder , facing the Gryffindors , leering to a man
But I booked the field said Wood , positively spitting with rage
I booked it110Ah , said Flint
But I 've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape
` I , Professor S
Snape , give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker
'You 've got a new Seeker ? said Wood , distracted
Where ? And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh , smaller boy , smirking all over his pale , pointed face
It was Draco Malfoy
Are n't you Lucius Malfoy 's son ? said Fred , looking at Malfoy with dislike
Funny you should mention Draco 's father , said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly
Let me show you the generous gift he 's made to the Slytherin team
All seven of them held out their broomsticks
Seven highly polished , brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors ' noses in the early morning sun
Very latest model
Only came out last month , said Flint carelessly , flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own
I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount
As for the old Cleansweeps - he smiled nastily at Fred and George , who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives - sweeps the board with them
None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment
Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits
Oh , look , said Flint
A field invasion
Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on
111What 's happening ? Ron asked Harry
Why are n't you playing ? And what 's he doing here ? He was looking at Malfoy , taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes
I 'm the new Slytherin Seeker , Weasley , said Malfoy , smugly
Everyone 's just been admiring the brooms my father 's bought our team
Ron gaped , open-mouthed , at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him
Good , are n't they ? said Malfoy smoothly
But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms , too
You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives ; I expect a museum would bid for them
The Slytherin team howled with laughter
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in , said Hermione sharply
They got in on pure talent
The smug look on Malfoy 's face flickered
No one asked your opinion , you fiIthy little Mudblood , he spat
Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words
Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him , Alicia shrieked , How dare you ; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes , pulled out his wand , yelling , You 'll pay for that one , Malfoy and pointed it furiously under Flint 's arm at Malfoys face
A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron 's wand , hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass
12Ron Ron Are you all right ? squealed Hermione
Ron opened his mouth to speak , but no words came out
Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap
The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter
Flint was doubled up , hanging onto his new broomstick for support
Malfoy was on all fours , banging the ground with his fist
The Gryffindors were gathered around Ron , who kept belching large , glistening slugs
Nobody seemed to want to touch him
We 'd better get him to Hagrid 's , it 's nearest , said Harry to Hermione , who nodded bravely , and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms
What happened , Harry ? What happened ? Is he ill ? But you can cure him , ca n't you ? Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field
Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front
Oooh , said Colin , fascinated and raising his camera
Can you hold him still , Harry ? Get out of the way , Colin said Harry angrily
He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest
Nearly there , Ron , said Hermione as the gamekeeper 's cabin came into view
You 'll be all right in a minute - almost there -They were within twenty feet of Hagrid 's house when the front door opened , but it was n't Hagrid who emerged
Gilderoy Lockhart , wearing robes of palest mauve today , came striding out
Quick , behind here , Harry hissed , dragging Ron behind a nearby bush
Hermione followed , somewhat reluctantly
113 It 's a simple matter if you know what you 're doing Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid
If you need help , you know where I am I 'll let you have a copy of my book
I 'm surprised you have n't already got one - I 'll sign one tonight and send it over
Well , good-bye And he strode away toward the castle
Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight , then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid 's front door
They knocked urgently
Hagrid appeared at once , looking very grumpy , but his expression brightened when he saw who it was
Bin wonderin ' when you 'd come ter see me - come in , come in - thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again -Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one- roomed cabin , which had an enormous bed in one corner , a fire crackling merrily in the other
Hagrid did n't seem perturbed by Ron 's slug problem , which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a chair
Better out than in , he said cheerfully , plunking a large copper basin in front of him
Get 'em all up , Ron
I do n't think there 's anything to do except wait for it to stop , said Hermione anxiously , watching Ron bend over the basin
That 's a difficult curse to work at the best of times , but with a broken wand -Hagrid was bustling around making them tea
His boarhound , Fang , was slobbering over Harry
What did Lockhart want with you , Hagrid ? Harry asked , scratching Fang 's ears
Givin ' me advice on gettin ' kelpies out of a well , growled114Hagrid , moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot
Like I don ' know
An ' bangin ' on about some banshee he banished
If one word of it was true , I 'll eat my kettle
It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts ' teacher , and Harry looked at him in surprise
Hermione , however , said in a voice somewhat higher than usual , I think you 're being a bit unfair
Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job -He was the on ' man for the job , said Hagrid , offering them a Yplate of treacle fudge , while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin
An ' I mean the on ' one
Gettin ' very difficult ter find anyone fer Ythe Dark Arts job
People are n't too keen ter take it on , see
They 're startin ' ter think it 's jinxed
No one 's lasted long fer a while now
So tell me , said Hagrid , jerking his head at Ron
Who was he tryin ' ter curse ? Malfoy called Hermione something - it must 've been really bad , because everyone went wild
It was bad , said Ron hoarsely , emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty
Malfoy called her ` Mudblood , ' Hagrid -Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance
Hagrid looked outraged
He didn ' he growled at Hermione
He did , she said
But I do n't know what it means
I could tell it was really rude , of course -It 's about the most insulting thing he could think of , gasped Ron , coming back up
Mudblood 's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born - you know , non-magic parents
There are115some wizards - like Malfoy 's family - who think they 're better than everyone else because they 're what people call pure-blood
He gave a small burp , and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand
He threw it into the basin and continued , I mean , the rest of us know it does n't make any difference at all
Look at Neville Longbottom - he 's pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up
An ' they have n't invented a spell our Hermione can ' do , said Hagrid proudly , making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta
It 's a disgusting thing to call someone , said Ron , wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand
Dirty blood , see
Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway
If we had n't married Muggles we'd 've died out
He retched and ducked out of sight again
Well , I don ' blame yeh fer tryin ' ter curse him , Ron , said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin
Bu ' maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired
Spect Lucius Malfoy would 've come marchin ' up ter school if yeh 'd cursed his son
Least yer not in trouble
Harry would have pointed out that trouble did n't come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth , but he could n't ; Hagrid 's treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together
Harry , said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought
Got ta bone ter pick with yeh
I 've heard you 've bin givin ' out signed photos
How come I have n't got one ? Furious , Harry wrenched his teeth apart
I have not been giving out signed photos , he said hotly
If Lockhart 's still spreading that around -116But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing
I 'm on ' y jokin ' , he said , patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table
I knew yeh had n't really
I told Lockhart yeh didn ' need teh
Yer more famous than him without tryin
Bet he did n't like that , said Harry , sitting up and rubbing his chin
Don ' think he did , said Hagrid , his eyes twinkling
An ' then I told him Id never read one o ' his books an ' he decided ter go
Treacle fudge , Ron ? he added as Ron reappeared
No thanks , said Ron weakly
Better not risk it
Come an ' see what I 've bin growin ' , said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea
In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid 's house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen
Each was the size of a large boulder
Gettin ' on well , are n't they ? said Hagrid happily
Fer the Halloween feast
should be big enough by then
What 've you been feeding them ? said Harry
Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone
Well , I 've bin givin ' them - you know - a bit o ' help -Harry noticed Hagrid 's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin
Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked ; in fact , he had the strong impression that Hagrid 's old school wand was concealed inside it
Hagrid was n't supposed to use magic
He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year , but Harry had never found out why -any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his117throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed
An Engorgement Charm , I suppose ? said Hermione , halfway between disapproval and amusement
Well , you 've done a good job on them
That 's what yer little sister said , said Hagrid , nodding at Ron
Met her jus ' yesterday
Hagrid looked sideways at Harry , his beard twitching
Said she was jus ' lookin ' round the grounds , but I reckon she was hopin ' she might run inter someone else at my house
He winked at Harry
If yeh ask me , she wouldn ' say no ter a signed -Oh , shut up , said Harry
Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs
Watch it Hagrid roared , pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins
It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn , he was keen to go back to school to eat
They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle , Ron hiccoughing occasionally , but only bringing up two very small slugs
They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out , There you are , Potter - Weasley
Professor McGonagall was walking toward them , looking stern
You will both do your detentions this evening
What 're we doing , Professor ? said Ron , nervously suppressing a burp
You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr
Filch , said Professor McGonagall
And no magic , Weasley - elbow grease
Argus Filch , the caretaker , was loathed by every student in the school
And you , Potter , will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail , said Professor McGonagall
Oh n - Professor , ca n't I go and do the trophy room , too ? said Harry desperately
Certainly not , said Professor McGonagall , raising her eyebrows
Professor Lockhart requested you particularly
Eight o'clock sharp , both of you
Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom , Hermione behind them , wearing a well-you-did-break-school- rules sort of expression
Harry did n't enjoy his shepherd 's pie as much as he 'd thought
Both he and Ron felt they 'd got the worse deal
Filch 'll have me there all night , said Ron heavily
No magic There must be about a hundred cups in that room
I 'm no good at Muggle cleaning
I 'd swap anytime , said Harry hollowly
I 've had loads of practice with the Dursleys
Answering Lockhart 's fan mail
he 'll be a nightmare
Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away , and in what seemed like no time , it was five minutes to eight , and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart 's office
He gritted his teeth and knocked
The door flew open at once
Lockhart beamed down at him
Ah , here 's the scalawag he said
Come in , Harry , come in -Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Lockhart
He had even signed a few of them
Another large pile lay on his desk
You can address the envelopes Lockhart told Harry , as though this was a huge treat
This first one 's to Gladys Gudgeon , bless her - huge fan of mine -The minutes snailed by
Harry let Lockhart 's voice wash over him , occasionally saying , Mmm and Right and Yeah
Now and then he caught a phrase like , Fame 's a fickle friend , Harry , or Celebrity is as celebrity does , remember that
The candles burned lower and lower , making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him
Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope , writing out Veronica Smethley 's address
It must be nearly time to leave , Harry thought miserably , please let it be nearly time
And then he heard something - something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart 's prattle about his fans
It was a voice , a voice to chill the bone marrow , a voice of breathtaking , ice-cold venom
come to me
Let me rip you
Let me tear you
Let me kill you
Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley 's street
What ? he said loudly
I know said Lockhart
Six solid months at the top of the best- seller list Broke all recordsNo , said Harry frantically
That voiceSorry ? said Lockhart , looking puzzled
What voice ? That - that voice that said - did n't you hear it ? Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment
3-2o What are you talking about , Harry ? Perhaps you 're getting a litde drowsy ? Great Scott - look at the time We 've been here nearly four hours Id never have believed it - the time 's flown , has n't it ? Harry did n't answer
He was straining his ears to hear the voice again , but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he must n't expect a treat like this every time he got detention
Feeling dazed , Harry left
It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty
Harry went straight up to the dormitory
Ron was n't back yet
Harry pulled on his pajamas , got into bed , and waited
Half an hour later , Ron arrived , nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room
My muscles have all seized up , he groaned , sinking on his bed
Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was satisfied
And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School
Took ages to get the slime off
How was it with Lockhart ? Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville , Dean , and Seamus , Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard
And Lockhart said he could n't hear it ? said Ron
Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight
D'you think he was lying ? But I do n't get it - even someone invisible would 've had to open the door
I know , said Harry , lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him
I do n't get it either
12-1 122October arrived , spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle
Madam Pomfrey , the nurse , was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students
Her Pepperup potion worked instantly , though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward
Ginny Weasley , who had been looking pale , was bullied into taking some by Percy
The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire
Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end ; the lake rose , the flower beds turned into muddy streams , and Hagrid 's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds
Oliver Wood 's enthusiasm for regular training sessions , however , was not dampened , which was why Harry was to be found , late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween , returning to Gryffindor Tower , drenched to the skin and splattered with mud
123Even aside from the rain and wind it had n't been a happy practice session
Fred and George , who had been spying on the Slytherin team , had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones
They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs , shooting through the air like missiles
As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was
Nearly Headless Nick , the ghost of Gryffindor Tower , was staring morosely out of a window , muttering under his breath ,
do n't fulfill their requirements
half an inch , if that
Hello , Nick , said Harry
Hello , hello , said Nearly Headless Nick , starting and looking round
He wore a dashing , plumed hat on his long curly hair , and a tunic with a ruff , which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed
He was pale as smoke , and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside
You look troubled , young Potter , said Nick , folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet
So do you , said Harry
Ah , Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand , a matter of no importance
It 's not as though I really wanted to join
Thought I 'd apply , but apparently I 'do n't fulfill requirements ' -In spite of his airy tone , there was a look of great bitterness on his face
But you would think , would n't you , he erupted suddenly , pulling the letter back out of his pocket , that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt ? 124Oh - yes , said Harry , who was obviously supposed to agree
I mean , nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean , and my head had come off properly , I mean , it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule
However - Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously : 'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies
You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo
It is with the greatest regret , therefore , that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements
With very best wishes , Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore
Fuming , Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away
Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on , Harry Most people would think that 's good and beheaded , but oh , no , it 's not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore
Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said , in a far calmer tone , So - what 's bothering you ? Anything I can do ? No , said Harry
Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -The rest of Harry 's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles
He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes
It was Mrs
Norris , the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker , Argus Filch , as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students
You 'd better get out of here , Harry , said Nick quickly
Filch is n't in a good mood - he 's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five
He 's been cleaning all morning , and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place -
125Right , said Harry , backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs
Norris , but not quickly enough
Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat , Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry 's right , wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker
There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head , and his nose was unusually purple
Filth he shouted , his jowls aquiver , his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry 's Quidditch robes
Mess and muck everywhere I 've had enough of it , I tell you Follow me , PotterSo Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs , doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor
Harry had never been inside Filch 's office before ; it was a place most students avoided
The room was dingy and windowless , lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling
A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place
Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls ; from their labels , Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished
Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves
A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch 's desk
It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling
Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment
Dung , he muttered furiously , great sizzling dragon bogies
I 've had enough of it
make an example
where 's the form
126He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him , dipping his long black quill into the ink pot
It was only a bit of mud said Harry
It 's only a bit of mud to you , boy , but to me it 's an extra hour scrubbingshouted Filch , a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose
befouling the castle
Dabbing at his streaming nose , Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall
But as Filch lowered his quill , there was a great BANG on the ceiling of the office , which made the oil lamp rattle
PEEVES Filch roared , flinging down his quill in a transport of rage
I 'll have you this time , I 'll have youAnd without a backward glance at Harry , Filch ran flat-footed from the office , Mrs
Norris streaking alongside him
Peeves was the school poltergeist , a grinning , airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress
Harry did n't much like Peeves , but could n't help feeling grateful for his timing
Hopefully , whatever Peeves had done and it sounded as though he 'd wrecked something very big this time ) would distract Filch from Harry
Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back , Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk
There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form : a large , glossy , purple envelope with silver lettering on the front
With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch was n't on his way back , Harry picked up the envelope and read : kwikspell A Correspondence Course in Beginners ' Magic
127Intrigued , Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside
More curly silver writing on the front page said : Feel out of step in the world of modern magic ? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells ? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork ? There is an answer Kwikspell is an all-new , fail-safe , quick-result , easy-learn course
Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method Madam Z
Nettles of Topsham writes : I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke Now , after a Kwikspell course , I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution Warlock D
Prod of Didsbury says : My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms , but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak Thank you , Kwikspell Fascinated , Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope 's contents
Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course ? Did this mean he was n't a proper wizard ? Harry was just reading Lesson One : Holding Your Wand Some Useful Tips ) when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back
Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope , Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened
Filch was looking triumphant
That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully to Mrs
We 'll have Peeves out this time , my sweet -His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope , which , Harry realized too late , was lying two feet away from where it had started
Filch 's pasty face went brick red
Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury
Filch hobbled across to his desk , snatched up the envelope , and threw it into a drawer
Have you - did you read - ? he sputtered
128No , Harry lied quickly
Filch 's knobbly hands were twisting together
If I thought you 'd read my private - not that it 's mine - for a friend - be that as it may - however -Harry was staring at him , alarmed ; Filch had never looked madder
His eyes were popping , a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks , and the tartan scarf did n't help
Very well - go - and do n't breathe a word - not that - however , if you did n't read - go now , I have to write up Peeves ' report - go -Amazed at his luck , Harry sped out of the office , up the corridor , and back upstairs
To escape from Filch 's office without punishment was probably some kind of school record
Harry Harry Did it work ? Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom
Behind him , Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height
I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch 's office , said Nick eagerly
Thought it might distract him -Was that you ? said Harry gratefully
Yeah , it worked , I did n't even get detention
Thanks , NickThey set off up the corridor together
Nearly Headless Nick , Harry noticed , was still holding Sir Patrick 's rejection letter
129I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt , Harry said
Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him
He wished he had n't ; it was like stepping through an icy shower
But there is something you could do for me , said Nick excitedly
Harry - would I be asking too much - but no , you would n't want -What is it ? said Harry
Well , this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday , said Nearly Headless Nick , drawing himself up and looking dignified
Oh , said Harry , not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this
I 'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons
Friends will be coming from all over the country
It would be such an honor if you would attend
Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome , too , of course - but I daresay you 'd rather go to the school feast ? He watched Harry on tenterhooks
No , said Harry quickly , I 'll come -My dear boy Harry Potter , at my deathday party And - he hesitated , looking excited - do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me ? Of - of course , said Harry
Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him
A deathday party ? said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room
I bet there are n't many living people who can say they 've been to one of those - it 'll be fascinating
130Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died ? said Ron , who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy
Sounds dead depressing to me
Rain was still lashing the windows , which were now inky black , but inside all looked bright and cheerful
The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading , talking , doing homework or , in the case of Fred and George Weasley , trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander
Fred had rescued the brilliant orange , fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people
Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air , emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room
The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George , the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander 's mouth , and its escape into the fire , with accompanying explosions , drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry 's mind
By the time Halloween arrived , Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party
The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast ; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats , Hagrid 's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in , and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment
A promise is a promise , Hermione reminded Harry bossily
You said you 'd go to the deathday party
So at seven o'clock , Harry , Ron , and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall , which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles , and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons
131The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick 's party had been lined with candles , too , though the effect was far from cheerful : These were long , thin , jet-black tapers , all burning bright blue , casting a dim , ghostly light even over their own living faces
The temperature dropped with every step they took
As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him , he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard
Is that supposed to be music ? Ron whispered
They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes
My dear friends , he said mournfully
so pleased you could come
He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside
It was an incredible sight
The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white , translucent people , mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor , waltzing to the dreadful , quavering sound of thirty musical saws , played by an orchestra on a raised , black-draped platform
A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles
Their breath rose in a mist before them ; it was like stepping into a freezer
Shall we have a look around ? Harry suggested , wanting to warm up his feet
Careful not to walk through anyone , said Ron nervously , and they set off around the edge of the dance floor
They passed a group of gloomy nuns , a ragged man wearing chains , and the Fat Friar , a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost , who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead
Harry was n't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron , a gaunt , staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains , was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts
132Oh , no , said Hermione , stopping abruptly
Turn back , turn back , I do n't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -Who ? said Harry as they backtracked quickly
She haunts one of the toilets in the girls ' bathroom on the first floor , said Hermione
She haunts a toilet ? Yes
It 's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place
I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it ; it 's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you -Look , food said Ron
On the other side of the dungeon was a long table , also covered in black velvet
They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks , horrified
The smell was quite disgusting
Large , rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters ; cakes , burned charcoal-black , were heaped on salvers ; there was a great maggoty haggis , a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and , in pride of place , an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone , with tar-like icing forming the words , Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington died 31st October , 1492 Harry watched , amazed , as a portly ghost approached the table , crouched low , and walked through it , his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon
Can you taste it if you walk though it ? Harry asked him
Almost , said the ghost sadly , and he drifted away
133I expect they 've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor , said Hermione knowledgeably , pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis
Can we move ? I feel sick , said Ron
They had barely turned around , however , when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them
Hello , Peeves , said Harry cautiously
Unlike the ghosts around them , Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent
He was wearing a bright orange party hat , a revolving bow tie , and a broad grin on his wide , wicked face
Nibbles ? he said sweetly , offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus
No thanks , said Hermione
Heard you talking about poor Myrtle , said Peeves , his eyes dancing
Rude you was about poor Myrtle
He took a deep breath and bellowed , OY MYRTLEOh , no , Peeves , do n't tell her what I said , she 'll be really upset , Hermione whispered frantically
I did n't mean it , I do n't mind her - er , hello , Myrtle
The squat ghost of a girl had glided over
She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen , half-hidden behind lank hair and thick , pearly spectacles
What ? she said sulkily
How are you , Myrtle ? said Hermione in a falsely bright voice
It 's nice to see you out of the toilet
Miss Granger was just talking about you - said Peeves slyly in Myrtle 's ear
Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight , said Hermione , glaring at Peeves
Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously
You 're making fun of me , she said , silver tears welling rapidly in her small , see-through eyes
No - honestly - did n't I just say how nice Myrtle 's looking ? said Hermione , nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs
Oh , yeah -She did -Do n't lie to me , Myrtle gasped , tears now flooding down her face , while Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder
D'you think I do n't know what people call me behind my back ? Fat Myrtle Ugly Myrtle Miserable , moaning , moping MyrtleYou 've forgotten pimply , Peeves hissed in her ear
Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon
Peeves shot after her , pelting her with moldy peanuts , yelling , PimplyPimplyOh , dear , said Hermione sadly
Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd
135Enjoying yourselves ? Oh , yes , they lied
Not a bad turnout , said Nearly Headless Nick proudly
The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent
It 's nearly time for my speech , I 'd better go and warn the orchestra
The orchestra , however , stopped playing at that very moment
They , and everyone else in the dungeon , fell silent , looking around in excitement , as a hunting horn sounded
Oh , here we go , said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly
Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses , each ridden by a headless horseman
The assembly clapped wildly ; Harry started to clap , too , but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick 's face
The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted , rearing and plunging
At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm , from which position he was blowing the horn
The ghost leapt down , lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd everyone laughed ) , and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick , squashing his head back onto his neck
Nick he roared
How are you ? Head still hanging in there ? He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder
Welcome , Patrick , said Nick stiffly
Live 'uns said Sir Patrick , spotting Harry , Ron , and Hermione and giving a huge , fake jump of astonishment , so that his head fell off again the crowd howled with laughter )
136Very amusing , said Nearly Headless Nick darkly
Do n't mind Nick shouted Sir Patrick 's head from the floor
Still upset we wo n't let him join the Hunt But I mean to say - look at the fellow -I think , said Harry hurriedly , at a meaningful look from Nick , Nick 's very - frightening and - er -Ha yelled Sir Patrick 's head
Bet he asked you to say thatIf I could have everyone 's attention , it 's time for my speech said Nearly Headless Nick loudly , striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight
My late lamented lords , ladies , and gentlemen , it is my great sorrow
But nobody heard much more
Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch
Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience , but gave up as Sir Patrick 's head went sailing past him to loud cheers
Harry was very cold by now , not to mention hungry
I ca n't stand much more of this , Ron muttered , his teeth chattering , as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor
Let 's go , Harry agreed
They backed toward the door , nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them , and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles
Pudding might not be finished yet , said Ron hopefully , leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall
137And then Harry heard it
It was the same voice , the same cold , murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart 's office
He stumbled to a halt , clutching at the stone wall , listening with all his might , looking around , squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway
Harry , what 're you - ? It 's that voice again - shut up a minute -
for so long
Listen said Harry urgently , and Ron and Hermione froze , watching him
time to kill
The voice was growing fainter
Harry was sure it was moving away - moving upward
A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling ; how could it be moving upward ? Was it a phantom , to whom stone ceilings did n't matter ? This way , he shouted , and he began to run , up the stairs , into the entrance hall
It was no good hoping to hear anything here , the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall
Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor , Ron and Hermione clattering behind him
Harry , what 're we -SHH
138Harry strained his ears
Distantly , from the floor above , and growing fainter still , he heard the voice :
I smell blood
I SMELL BLOODHis stomach lurched - It 's going to kill someone he shouted , and ignoring Ron 's and Hermione 's bewildered faces , he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time , trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps - Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor , Ron and Hermione panting behind him , not stopping until they turned a corner into the last , deserted passage
Harry , what was that all about ? said Ron , wiping sweat off his face
I could n't hear anything
But Hermione gave a sudden gasp , pointing down the corridor
LookSomething was shining on the wall ahead
They approached slowly , squinting through the darkness
Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows , shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches
the chamber of secrets has been opened
enemies of the heir , beware
What 's that thing - hanging underneath ? said Ron , a slight quiver in his voice
As they edged nearer , Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of water on the floor ; Ron and Hermione grabbed him , and they inched toward the message , eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it
All three of them realized what it was at once , and leapt backward with a splash
Norris , the caretaker 's cat , was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket
She was stiff as a board , her eyes wide and staring
For a few seconds , they did n't move
Then Ron said , Let 's get out of here
Should n't we try and help - Harry began awkwardly
Trust me , said Ron
We do n't want to be found here
But it was too late
A rumble , as though of distant thunder , told them that the feast had just ended
From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs , and the loud , happy talk of well-fed people ; next moment , students were crashing into the passage from both ends
The chatter , the bustle , the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat
Harry , Ron , and Hermione stood alone , in the middle of the corridor , as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight
Then someone shouted through the quiet
Enemies of the Heir , beware You 'll be next , MudbloodsIt was Draco Malfoy
He had pushed to the front of the crowd , his cold eyes alive , his usually bloodless face flushed , as he grinned at the sight of the hanging , immobile cat
CHAPTER NINETHE WRTITING ON THE WALLWhat 's going on here ? What 's going on ? Attracted no doubt by Malfoy 's shout , Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the crowd
Then he saw Mrs
Norris and fell back , clutching his face in horror
My cat My cat What 's happened to Mrs
Norris ? he shrieked
And his popping eyes fell on Harry
You You 've murdered my cat You 've killed her I 'll kill you I 'll -ArgusDumbledore had arrived on the scene , followed by a number of other teachers
In seconds , he had swept past Harry , Ron , and Hermione and detached Mrs
Norris from the torch bracket
Come with me , Argus , he said to Filch
You , too , Mr
Weasley , Miss Granger
Lockhart stepped forward eagerly
140My office is nearest , Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -Thank you , Gilderoy , said Dumbledore
The silent crowd parted to let them pass
Lockhart , looking excited and important , hurried after Dumbledore ; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape
As they entered Lockhart 's darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls ; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight , their hair in rollers
The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back
Dumbledore lay Mrs
Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her
Harry , Ron , and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight , watching
The tip of Dumbledore 's long , crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs
He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles , his long fingers gently prodding and poking
Professor McGonagall was bent almost as close , her eyes narrowed
Snape loomed behind them , half in shadow , wearing a most peculiar expression : It was as though he was trying hard not to smile
And Lockhart was hovering around all of them , making suggestions
It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian Torture - I 've seen it used many times , so unlucky I was n't there , I know the very countercurse that would have saved her
Lockhart 's comments were punctuated by Filch 's dry , racking sobs
He was slumped in a chair by the desk , unable to look at Mrs
Norris , his face in his hands
Much as he detested Filch , Harry141could n't help feeling a bit sorry for him , though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch , he would be expelled for sure
Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping Mrs
Norris with his wand but nothing happened : She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed
I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou , said Lockhart , a series of attacks , the full story 's in my autobiography , I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets , which cleared the matter up at once
The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked
One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net
At last Dumbledore straightened up
She 's not dead , Argus , he said softly
Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented
Not dead ? choked Filch , looking through his fingers at Mrs
But why 's she all - all stiff and frozen ? She has been Petrified , said Dumbledore Ah I thought so said Lockhart )
But how , I can not say
Ask him shrieked Filch , turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry
No second year could have done this , said Dumbledore firmly
it would take Dark Magic of the most advanced -He did it , he did it Filch spat , his pouchy face purpling
You saw what he wrote on the wall He found - in my office - he knows I 'm a - I 'm a - Filch 's face worked horribly
He knows I 'm a Squib he finished
142I never touched Mrs
Norris Harry said loudly , uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him , including all the Lockharts on the walls
And I do n't even know what a Squib is
Rubbish snarled Filch
He saw my Kwikspell letterIf I might speak , Headmaster , said Snape from the shadows , and Harry 's sense of forboding increased ; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good
Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time , he said , a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it
But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here
Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all ? Why was n't he at the Halloween feast ? Harry , Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party
there were hundreds of ghosts , theyll tell you we were there -But why not join the feast afterward ? said Snape , his black eyes glittering in the candlelight
Why go up to that corridor ? Ron and Hermione looked at Harry
Because - because - Harry said , his heart thumping very fast ; something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear , because we were tired and wanted to go to bed , he said
Without any supper ? said Snape , a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face
I did n't think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties
We were n't hungry , said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble
Snape 's nasty smile widened
143I suggest , Headmaster , that Potter is not being entirely truthful , he said
It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story
I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest
Really , Severus , said Professor McGonagall sharply , I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch
This cat was n't hit over the head with a broomstick
There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong
Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look
His twinkling light- blue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed
Innocent until proven guilty , Severus , he said firmly
Snape looked furious
So did Filch
My cat has been Petrified he shrieked , his eyes popping
I want to see some punishmentWe will be able to cure her , Argus , said Dumbledore patiently
Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes
As soon as they have reached their full size , I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs
I 'll make it , Lockhart butted in
I must have done it a hundred times
I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -Excuse me , said Snape icily
But I believe I am the Potions master at this school
There was a very awkward pause
You may go , Dumbledore said to Harry , Ron , and Hermione
They went , as quickly as they could without actually running
When they were a floor up from Lockhart 's office , they turned into144an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them
Harry squinted at his friends ' darkened faces
D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard ? No , said Ron , without hesitation
Hearing voices no one else can hear is n't a good sign , even in the wizarding world
Something in Ron 's voice made Harry ask , You do believe me , do n't you ? 'Course I do , said Ron quickly
But -you must admit it 's weird
I know it 's weird , said Harry
The whole thing 's weird
What was that writing on the wall about ? The Cbamber Has Been Opened
What 's that supposed to mean ? You know , it rings a sort of bell , said Ron slowly
I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once
might 've been Bill
And what on earth 's a Squib ? said Harry
To his surprise , Ron stifled a snigger
Well - it 's not funny really - but as it 's Filch , he said
A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but has n't got any magic powers
Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards , but Squibs are quite unusual
If Filch 's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course , I reckon he must be a Squib
It would explain a lot
Like why he hates students so much
Ron gave a satisfied smile
A clock chimed somewhere
Midnight , said Harry
We 'd better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else
145For a few days , the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs
Filch kept it fresh in everyone 's minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked , as though he thought the attacker might come back
Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs
Skower 's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover , but to no effect ; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone
When Filch was n't guarding the scene of the crime , he was skulking red- eyed through the corridors , lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like breathing loudly ' and looking happy
Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs
According to Ron , she was a great cat lover
But you have n't really got to know Mrs
Norris , Ron told her bracingly
Honestly , we 're much better off without her
Ginny 's lip trembled
Stuff like this does n't often happen at Hogwarts , Ron assured her
They 'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time
I just hope he 's got time to Petrify Filch before he 's expelled
I 'm only joking - Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched
The attack had also had an effect on Hermione
It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading , but she was now doing almost nothing else
Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to , and not until the following Wednesday did they find out
Harry had been held back in Potions , where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks
After a hurried lunch , he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library , and saw Justin Finch- Fletchley , the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology , coming146toward him
Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him , turned abruptly , and sped off in the opposite direction
Harry found Ron at the back of the library , measuring his History of Magic homework
Professor Binns had asked for a threefoot-long composition on The Medieval Assembly of EuropeanWizards
I do n't believe it , I 'm still eight inches short said Ron furiously , letting go of his parchment , which sprang back into a roll
And Hermione 's done four feet seven inches and her writing 's tiny
Where is she ? asked Harry , grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework
Somewhere over there , said Ron , pointing along the shelves
Looking for another book
I think she 's trying to read the whole library before Christmas
Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him
Dunno why you care
I thought he was a bit of an idiot , said Ron , scribbling away , making his writing as large as possible
All that junk about Lockhart being so great -Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves
She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them
All the copies of Hogwarts , A History have been taken out , she said , sitting down next to Harry and Ron
And there 's a two-week waiting list
I wish I had n't left my copy at home , but I could n't fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books
Why do you want it ? said Harry
141The same reason everyone else wants it , said Hermione , to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets
What 's that ? said Harry quickly
That 's just it
I ca n't remember , said Hermione , biting her lip
And I ca n't find the story anywhere else -Hermione , let me read your composition , said Ron desperately , checking his watch
No , I wo n't , said Hermione , suddenly severe
You 've had ten days to finish it -I only need another two inches , come on -The bell rang
Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic , bickering
History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule
Professor Binns , who taught it , was their only ghost teacher , and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard
Ancient and shriveled , many people said he had n't noticed he was dead
He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire ; his routine had not varied in the slightest since
Today was as boring as ever
Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor , occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date , then falling asleep again
He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before
Hermione put up her hand
Professor Binns , glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec148ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289 , looked amazed
Miss - er - ? Granger , Professor
I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets , said Hermione in a clear voice
Dean Thomas , who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open , gazing out of the window , jerked out of his trance ; Lavender Brown 's head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom 's elbow slipped off his desk
Professor Binns blinked
My subject is History of Magic , he said in his dry , wheezy voice
I deal with facts , Miss Granger , not myths and legends
He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk s-ping and continued , In September of that year , a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerersHe stuttered to a halt
Hermione 's hand was waving in the air again
Miss Grant ? Please , sir , do n't legends always have a basis in fact ? Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement , Harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before , alive or dead
Well , said Professor Binns slowly , yes , one could argue that , I suppose
He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before
However , the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational , even ludicrous tale -But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns 's every word
He looked dimly at them all , every face turned to his
Harry149could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest
Oh , very well , he said slowly
Let me see
the Chamber of Secrets
You all know , of course , that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age
The four school Houses are named after them : Godric Gryffindor , Helga Hufflepuff , Rowena Ravenclaw , and Salazar Slytherin
They built this castle together , far from prying Muggle eyes , for it was an age when magic was feared by common people , and witches and wizards suffered much persecution
He paused , gazed blearily around the room , and continued
For a few years , the founders worked in harmony together , seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated
But then disagreements sprang up between them
A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others
Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts
He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families
He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage , believing them to be untrustworthy
After a while , there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor , and Slytherin left the school
Professor Binns paused again , pursing his lips , looking like a wrinkled old tortoise
Reliable historical sources tell us this much , he said
But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets
The story goes that Slytherin had built a150hidden chamber in the castle , of which the other founders knew nothing
Slytherin , according to the legend , sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school
The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets , unleash the horror within , and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic
There was silence as he finished telling the story , but it was n't the usual , sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns 's classes
There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him , hoping for more
Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed
The whole thing is arrant nonsense , of course , he said
Naturally , the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber , many times , by the most learned witches and wizards
It does not exist
A tale told to frighten the gullible
Hermione 's hand was back in the air
Sir - what exactly do you mean by the ` horror within ' the Chamber ? That is believed to be some sort of monster , which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control , said Professor Binns in his dry , reedy voice
The class exchanged nervous looks
I tell you , the thing does not exist , said Professor Binns , shuffling his notes
There is no Chamber and no monster
But , sir , said Seamus Finnigan , if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin 's true heir , no one else would be able to find it , would they ? Nonsense , O'Flaherty , said Professor Binns in an aggravated151tone
If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses have n't found the thing -But , Professor , piped up Parvati Patil , you 'd probably have to use Dark Magic to open it -Just because a wizard does n't use Dark Magic does n't mean he ca n't , Miss Pennyfeather , snapped Professor Binns
I repeat , if the likes of Dumbledore -But maybe you 've got to be related to Slytherin , so Dumbledore could n't - began Dean Thomas , but Professor Binns had had enough
That will do , he said sharply
It is a myth It does not exist There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard I regret telling you such a foolish story We will return , if you please , to history , to solid , believable , verifiable factAnd within five minutes , the class had sunk back into its usual torpor
I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony , Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner
But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff
I would n't be in his house if you paid me
Honestly , if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin , I'd 've got the train straight back home
Hermione nodded fervently , but Harry did n't say anything
His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat152had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin
He could remember , as though it were yesterday , the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he 'd placed the hat on his head a year before : You could be great , you know , it 's all here in your head , and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness , no doubt about that
But Harry , who had already heard of Slytherin House 's reputation for turning out Dark wizards , had thought desperately , Not Slytherin and the hat had said , Oh , well , if you 're sure
better be Gryffindor
As they were shunted along in the throng , Colin Creevy went past
Hiya , HarryHullo , Colin , said Harry automatically
Harry - Harry - a boy in my class has been saying you'reBut Colin was so small he couldnt fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall ; they heard him squeak , See you , Harry and he was gone
What 's a boy in his class saying about you ? Hermione wondered
That I 'm Slytherin 's heir , I expect , said Harry , his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch- Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime
People here 'll believe anything , said Ron in disgust
The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty
D'you really think there 's a Chamber of Secrets ? Ron asked Hermione
I do n't know , she said , frowning
Dumbledore could n't cure 1,5 Mrs
Norris , and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be - well - human
As she spoke , they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened
They stopped and looked
The scene was just as it had been that night , except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket , and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message The Chamber of Secrets has been Opened
That 's where Filch has been keeping guard , Ron muttered
They looked at each other
The corridor was deserted
Ca n't hurt to have a poke around , said Harry , dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along , searching for clues
Scorch marks he said
Here - and here -Come and look at this said Hermione
This is funny
Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall
Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane , where around twenty spiders were scuttling , apparently fighting to get through a small crack
A long , silvery thread was dangling like a rope , as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside
Have you ever seen spiders act like that ? said Hermione wonderingly
No , said Harry , have you , Ron ? Ron ? He looked over his shoulder
Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run
What 's up ? said Harry
I - do n't - like - spiders , said Ron tensely
I never knew that , said Hermione , looking at Ron in surprise
You 've used spiders in Potions loads of times
154I do n't mind them dead , said Ron , who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window
I just do n't like the way they move
It 's not funny , said Ron , fiercely
If you must know , when I was three , Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick
You would n't like them either if you 'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and
He broke off , shuddering
Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh
Feeling they had better get off the subject , Harry said , Remember all that water on the floor ? Where did that come from ? Someone 's mopped it up
It was about here , said Ron , recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch 's chair and pointing
Level with this door
He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he 'd been burned
What 's the matter ? said Harry
Ca n't go in there , said Ron gruffly
That 's a girls ' toilet
Oh , Ron , there wo n't be anyone in there , said Hermione , standing up and coming over
That 's Moaning Myrtle 's place
Come on , let 's have a look
And ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign , she opened the door
It was the gloomiest , most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in
Under a large , cracked , and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks
The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles , burning low in their holders ; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges
-L 5,5Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall
When she reached it she said , Hello , Myrtle , how are you ? Harry and Ron went to look
Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet , picking a spot on her chin
This is a girls ' bathroom , she said , eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously
They 're not girls
No , Hermione agreed
I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here
She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor
Ask her if she saw anything , Harry mouthed at Hermione
What are you whispering ? said Myrtle , staring at him
Nothing , said Harry quickly
We wanted to ask -I wish people would stop talking behind my back said Myrtle , in a voice choked with tears
I do have feelings , you know , even if I am dead -Myrtle , no one wants to upset you , said Hermione
Harry only -No one wants to upset me That 's a good one howled Myrtle
My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my deathWe wanted to ask you if you 've seen anything funny lately , said Hermione quickly
Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween
Did you see anyone near here that night ? said Harry
I was n't paying attention , said Myrtle dramatically
Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then , of course , I remembered that I 'm - that I 'm Already dead , said Ron helpfully
IL 56Myrtle gave a tragic sob , rose up in the air , turned over , and dived headfirst into the toilet , splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight , although from the direction of her muffled sobs , she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend
Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open , but Hermione shrugged wearily and said , Honestly , that was almost cheerful for Myrtle
Come on , let 's go
Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle 's gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump
RONPercy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs , prefect badge agleam , an expression of complete shock on his face
That 's a girls ' bathroom he gasped
What were you - ? Just having a look around , Ron shrugged
Clues , you know -Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs
Get - away - from - there - Perry said , striding toward them and starting to bustle them along , flapping his arms
Do n't you care what this looks like ? Coming back here while everyone 's at dinner -Why should n't we be here ? said Ron hotly , stopping short and glaring at Percy
Listen , we never laid a finger on that catThat 's what I told Ginny , said Percy fiercely , but she still seems to think you 're going to be expelled , I 've never seen her so upset , crying her eyes out , you might think of her , all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business -You do n't care about Ginny , said Ron , whose ears were now157reddening
You 're just worried I 'm going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy -Five points from Gryffindor Percy said tersely , fingering his prefect badge
And I hope it teaches you a lesson No more detective work , or I 'll write to MumAnd he strode off , the back of his neck as red as Ron 's ears
Harry , Ron , and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night
Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework
When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges , it ignited the parchment
Fuming almost as much as his homework , Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 2 shut
To Harry 's surprise , Hermione followed suit
Who can it be , though ? she said in a quiet voice , as though continuing a conversation they had just been having
Who 'd want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts ? Let 's think , said Ron in mock puzzlement
Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum ? He looked at Hermione
Hermione looked back , unconvinced
If you 're talking about Malfoy -Of course I am said Ron
You heard him - ` You 'll be next , Mudbloods'- come on , you 've only got to look at his foul rat face to know it 's him -Malfoy , the Heir of Slytherin ? said Hermione skeptically
Look at his family , said Harry , closing his books , too
The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin ; he 's always boasting about it
They could easily be Slytherin 's descendants
His father 's definitely evil enough
158They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries said Ron
Handing it down , father to son
Well , said Hermione cautiously , I suppose it 's possible
But how do we prove it ? said Harry darkly
There might be a way , said Hermione slowly , dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy
Of course , it would be difficult
And dangerous , very dangerous
We 'd be breaking about fifty school rules , I expect -If , in a month or so , you feel like explaining , you will let us know , wo n't you ? said Ron irritably
All right , said Hermione coldly
What we 'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it 's us
But that 's impossible , Harry said as Ron laughed
No , it 's not , said Hermione
All we 'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion
What 's that ? said Ron and Harry together
Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -D'you think we 've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape ? muttered Ron
It transforms you into somebody else
Think about it We could change into three of the Slytherins
No one would know it was us
Malfoy would probably tell us anything
He 's probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now , if only we could hear him
This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me , said Ron , frowning
What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever ? It wears off after a while , said Hermione , waving her hand159impatiently
But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult
Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it 's bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library
There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section : You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher
Hard to see why we 'd want the book , really , said Ron , if we were n't going to try and make one of the potions
I think , said Hermione , that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory , we might stand a chance
Oh , come on , no teacher 's going to fall for that , said Ron
They 'd have to be really thick
CHAPTER TENTHE ROGUE BLUDGERince the disastrous episode of the pixies , Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class
Instead , he read passages from his books to them , and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits
He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions ; so far , Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse , a yeti with a head cold , and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him
Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson , this time acting a werewolf If he had n't had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood , he would have refused to do it
Nice loud howl , Harry - exactly - and then , if you 'll believe it , I pounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one hand , I managed to hold him down - with my other , I161put my wand to his throat -I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - he let out a piteous moan - go on , Harry - higher than that - good - the fur vanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man
Simple , yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks
The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet
Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best oneThe class began to leave
Harry returned to the back of the room , where Ron and Hermione were waiting
Ready ? Harry muttered
Wait till everyone 's gone , said Hermione nervously
She approached Lockhart 's desk , a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand , Harry and Ron right behind her
Er - Professor Lockhart ? Hermione stammered
I wanted to - to get this book out of the library
Just for background reading
She held out the piece of paper , her hand shaking slightly
But the thing is , it 's in the Restricted Section of the library , so I need a teacher to sign for it - I 'm sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venomsAh , Gadding with Ghouls said Lockhart , taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at her
Possibly my very favorite book
You enjoyed it ? -162Oh , yes , said Hermione eagerly
So clever , the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer -Well , I 'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help , said Lockhart warmly , and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill
Yes , nice , is n't it ? he said , misreading the revolted look on Ron 's face
I usually save it for book-signings
He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to Hermione
So , Harry , said Lockhart , while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag
Tomorrow 's the first Quidditch match of the season , I believe ? Gryffindor against Slytherin , is it not ? I hear you 're a useful player
I was a Seeker , too
I was asked to try for the National Squad , but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces
Still , if ever you feel the need for a little private training , do n't hesitate to ask
Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players
Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione
I do n't believe it , he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note
He did n't even look at the book we wanted
That 's because he 's a brainless git , said Ron
But who cares , we 've got what we needed -He is not a brainless git , said Hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library
Just because he said you were the best student of the year -They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library
Madam Pince , the librarian , was a thin , irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture
163Moste Potente Potions ? she repeated suspiciously , trying to take the note from Hermione ; but Hermione would n't let go
I was wondering if I could keep it , she said breathlessly
Oh , come on , said Ron , wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince
We 'll get you another autograph
Lockhart 'll sign anything if it stands still long enough
Madam Pince held the note up to the light , as though determined to detect a forgery , but it passed the test
She stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldy-looking book
Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left , trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty
Five minutes later , they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle 's out-of- order bathroom once again
Hermione had overridden Ron 's objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go , so they were guaranteed some privacy
Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall , but they were ignoring her , and she them
Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully , and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages
It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section
Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about , and there were some very unpleasant illustrations , which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head
Here it is , said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion
It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people
Harry sin164cerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces
This is the most complicated potion I 've ever seen , said Hermione as they scanned the recipe
Lacewing flies , leeches , fluxweed , and knotgrass , she murmured , running her finger down the list of ingredients
Well , they 're easy enough , they 're in the student store- cupboard , we can help ourselves
Oooh , look , powdered horn of a bicorn - do n't know where we 're going to get that - shredded skin of a boomslang -
that 'll be tricky , too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into
Excuse me ? said Ron sharply
What d'you mean , a bit of whoever we 're changing into ? I 'm drinking nothing with Crabbe 's toenails in it -Hermione continued as though she had n't heard him
We do n't have to worry about that yet , though , because we add those bits last
Ron turned , speechless , to Harry , who had another worry
D'you realize how much we 're going to have to steal , Hermione ? Shredded skin of a boomslang , that 's definitely not in the students ' cupboard
What 're we going to do , break into Snape 's private stores ? I do n't know if this is a good idea
Hermione shut the book with a snap
Well , if you two are going to chicken out , fine , she said
There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual
I do n't want to break rules , you know
I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion
But if you do n't want to find out if it 's Malfoy , I 'll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in ='165I never thought Id see the day when you 'd be persuading us to break rules , said Ron
All right , we 'll do it
But not toenails , okay ? How long will it take to make , anyway ? said Harry as Hermione , looking happier , opened the book again
Well , since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days
I 'd say it 'd be ready in about a month , if we can get all the ingredients
A month ? said Ron
Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle- borns in the school by then But Hermione 's eyes narrowed dangerously again , and he added swiftly , But it 's the best plan we 've got , so full steam ahead , I say
However , while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom , Ron muttered to Harry , It 'll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow
Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match
He was nervous , mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost , but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy
He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly
After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning , he got up , dressed , and went down to breakfast early , where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long , empty table , all looking uptight and not speaking much
As eleven o'clock approached , the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium
It was a muggy sort of day166with a hint of thunder in the air
Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms
The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes , then sat down to listen to Wood 's usual pre-match pep talk
Slytherin has better brooms than us , he began
No point denying it
But we 've got better people on our brooms
We 've trained harder than they have , we 've been flying in all weathers - Too true , muttered George Weasley
I have n't been properly dry since August ) - and we 're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime , Malfoy , buy his way onto their team
Chest heaving with emotion , Wood turned to Harry
It 'll be down to you , Harry , to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father
Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying , Harry , because we 've got to win today , we 've got to
So no pressure , Harry said Fred , winking at him
As they walked out onto the pitch , a roar of noise greeted them ; mainly cheers , because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten , but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard , too
Madam Hooch , the Quidditch teacher , asked Flint and Wood to shake hands , which they did , giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary
On my whistle , said Madam Hooch
With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward , the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky
Harry flew higher than any of them , squinting around for the Snitch
167All right there , Scarhead ? yelled Malfoy , shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom
Harry had no time to reply
At that very moment , a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him ; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed
Close one , Harry said George , streaking past him with his club in his hand , ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin
Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey , but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again
Harry dropped quickly to avoid it , and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy
Once again , the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry 's head
Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch
He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him
What was going on ? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this ; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible
Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end
Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might ; the Bludger was knocked off course
Gotcha Fred yelled happily , but he was wrong ; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry , the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed
It had started to rain ; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face , splattering onto his glasses
He did n't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan , who was commentating , say , Slytherin lead , sixty points to zero ='168The Slytherins ' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs , and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air
Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch , let alone catch it
Someone 's - tampered - with - this - Bludger - Fred grunted , swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on Harry
We need time out , said George , trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry 's nose at the same time
Wood had obviously got the message
Madam Hooch 's whistle rang out and Harry , Fred , and George dived for the ground , still trying to avoid the mad Bludger
What 's going on ? said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together , while Slytherins in the crowd jeered
We 're being flattened
Fred , George , where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring ? We were twenty feet above her , stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry , Oliver , said George angrily
Someone 's fixed it - it wo n't leave Harry alone
It has n't gone for anyone else all game
The Slytherins must have done something to it
But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch 's office since our last practice , and there was nothing wrong with them then
said Wood , anxiously
Madam Hooch was walking toward them
Over her shoulder , Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction
169Listen , said Harry as she came nearer and nearer , with you two flying around me all the time the only way I 'm going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve
Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one
Do n't be thick , said Fred
It 'll take your head off
Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys
I Oliver , this is insane , said Alicia Spinner angrily
You ca n't let Harry deal with that thing on his own
Let 's ask for an inquiry - ) ) If we stop now , we 'll have to forfeit the match said Harry
And we 're not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger Come on , Oliver , tell them to leave me aloneThis is all your fault , George said angrily to Wood
` Get the Snitch or die trying , ' what a stupid thing to tell him -Madam Hooch had joined them
Ready to resume play ? she asked Wood
Wood looked at the determined look on Harry 's face
All right , he said
Fred , George , you heard Harry -leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own
The rain was falling more heavily now
On Madam Hooch 's whistle , Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him
Higher and higher Harry climbed ; he looped and swooped , spiraled , zigzagged , and rolled
Slightly dizzy , he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open , rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down , avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger
He could hear laughter from the crowd ; he knew he must look very stupid , but the rogue Bludger was heavy and could n't change direction as quickly as Harry could ; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the170edges of the stadium , squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts , where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past WoodA whistling in Harry 's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again ; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction
Training for the ballet , Potter ? yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger , and he fled , the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him ; and then , glaring back at Malfoy in hatred , he saw it - the Golden Snitch
It was hovering inches above Malfoy 's left ear - and Malfoy , busy laughing at Harry , had n't seen it
For an agonizing moment , Harry hung in midair , not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch
He had stayed still a second too long
The Bludger had hit him at last , smashed into his elbow , and Harry felt his arm break
Dimly , dazed by the searing pain in his arm , he slid sideways on his rain-drenched broom , one knee still crooked over it , his right arm dangling useless at his side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack , this time W-ming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way , one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain : get to Malfoy
Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering , sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear : Malfoy thought Harry was attacking him
What the - he gasped , careening out of Harry 's way
Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch ; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only171gripping the broom with his legs , and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground , trying hard not to pass out
With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom
His arm was hanging at a very strange angle ; riddled with pain , he heard , as though from a distance , a good deal of whistling and shouting
He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand
Aha , he said vaguely
And he fainted
He came around , rain falling on his face , still lying on the field , with someone leaning over him
He saw a glitter of teeth
Oh , no , not you , he moaned
Does n't know what he 's saying , said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them
Not to worry , Harry
I 'm about to fix your arm
I 'll keep it like this , thanks
He tried to sit up , but the pain was terrible
He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby
I do n't want a photo of this , Colin , he said loudly
Lie back , Harry , said Lockhart soothingly
It 's a simple charm I 've used countless times -Why ca n't I just go to the hospital wing ? said Harry through clenched teeth
He should really , Professor , said a muddy Wood , who could n't help grinning even though his Seeker was injured
Great capture , Harry , really spectacular , your best yet , Id say -Through the thicket of legs around him , Harry spotted Fred and112George Weasley , wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box
It was still putting up a terrific fight
Stand back , said Lockhart , who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves
No - do n't - said Harry weakly , but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry 's arm
A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry 's shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips
It felt as though his arm was being deflated
He did n't dare look at what was happening
He had shut his eyes , his face turned away from his arm , but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly
His arm did n't hurt anymore - nor did it feel remotely like an arm
Ah , said Lockhart
Well , that can sometimes happen
But the point is , the bones are no longer broken
That 's the thing to bear in mind
So , Harry , just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah , Mr
Weasley , Miss Granger , would you escort him ? - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit
As Harry got to his feet , he felt strangely lopsided
Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side
What he saw nearly made him pass out again
Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick , flesh- colored rubber glove
He tried to move his fingers
Lockhart had n't mended Harry 's bones
He had removed them
Madam Pomfrey was n't at all pleased
You should have come straight to me she raged , holding up173the sad , limp remainder of what , half an hour before , had been a working arm
I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back - You will be able to , wo n't you ? said Harry desperately
I 'll be able to , certainly , but it will be painful , said Madam Pomfrey grimly , throwing Harry a pair of pajamas
You 'll have to stay the night
Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry 's bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas
It took a while to stuff the rubbery , boneless arm into a sleeve
How can you stick up for Lockhart now , Hermione , eh ? Ron called through the curtain as he pulled Harry 's limp fingers through the cuff
If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked
Anyone can make a mistake , said Hermione
And it does n't hurt anymore , does it , Harry ? No , said Harry , getting into bed
But it does n't do anything else either
As he swung himself onto the bed , his arm flapped pointlessly
Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain
Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro
You 're in for a rough night , she said , pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him
Regrowing bones is a nasty business
So was taking the Skele-Gro
It burned Harry 's mouth and throat as it went down , making him cough and splutter
Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers , Madam Pomfrey re114treated , leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water
We won , though , said Ron , a grin breaking across his face
That was some catch you made
he looked ready to kill
I want to know how he fixed that Bludger , said Hermione darkly
We can add that to the list of questions we 'll ask him when we 've taken the Polyjuice Potion , said Harry , sinking back onto his pillows
I hope it tastes better than this stuff
If it 's got bits of Slytherins in it ? You 've got to be joking , said Ron
The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment
Filthy and soaking wet , the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry
Unbelievable flying , Harry , said George
I 've just seen Mar cus Flint yelling at Malfoy
Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing
Malfoy did n't seem too happy
They had brought cakes , sweets , and bottles of pumpkin juice ; they gathered around Harry 's bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over , shouting , This boy needs rest , he 's got thirty-three bones to regrow Out OUT And Harry was left alone , with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm
Hours and hours later , Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain : His arm now felt full oflarge splinters
For a second , he thought that was what had woken him
Then , with a thrill of horror , he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark
Get off he said loudly , and then , DobbyThe house-elf 's goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness
A single tear was running down his long , pointed nose
Harry Potter came back to school , he whispered miserably
Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter
Ah sir , why did n't you heed Dobby ? Why did n't Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train ? Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby 's sponge away
What 're you doing here ? he said
And how did you know I missed the train ? Dobby 's lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion
It was you he said slowly
You stopped the barrier from letting us throughIndeed yes , sir , said Dobby , nodding his head vigorously , ears flapping
Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward - he showed Harry ten long , bandaged fingers - but Dobby did n't care , sir , for he thought Harry Potter was safe , and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another wayHe was rocking backward and forward , shaking his ugly head
Dobby was 'so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts , he let his master 's dinner burn Such a flogging Dobby never had , sir
176Harry slumped back onto his pillows
You nearly got Ron and me expelled , he said fiercely
You 'd better get lost before my bones come back , Dobby , or I might strangle you
Dobby smiled weakly
Dobby is used to death threats , sir
Dobby gets them five times a day at home
He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore , looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself
Why d'you wear that thing , Dobby ? he asked curiously
This , sir ? said Dobby , plucking at the pillowcase
'T is a mark of the house-elf 's enslavement , sir
Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes , sir
The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock , sir , for then he would be free to leave their house forever
Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly , Harry Potter must go home Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make -Your Bludger ? said Harry , anger rising once more
What d'you mean , your Bludger ? You made that Bludger try and kill me ? Not kill you , sir , never kill you said Dobby , shocked
Dobby wants to save Harry Potter 's life Better sent home , grievously injured , than remain here sir Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent homeOh , is that all ? said Harry angrily
I do n't suppose you 're going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces ? Ah , if Harry Potter only knew Dobby groaned , more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase
If he knew what he means 177to us , to the lowly , the enslaved , we dregs of the magical world Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of his powers , sir We house-elfs were treated like vermin , sir Of course , Dobby is still treated like that , sir , he admitted , drying his face on the pillowcase
But mostly , sir , life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
Harry Potter survived , and the Dark Lord 's power was broken , and it was a new dawn , sir , and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end , sit
And now , at Hogwarts , terrible things are to happen , are perhaps happening already , and Dobby can not let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself , now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once moreDobby froze , horrorstruck , then grabbed Harry 's water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head , toppling out of sight
A second later , he crawled back onto the bed , cross-eyed , muttering , Bad Dobby , very bad Dobby
So there is a Chamber of Secrets ? Harry whispered
And did you say it 's been opened before ? Tell me , DobbyHe seized the elf 's bony wrist as Dobby 's hand inched toward the water jug
But I 'm not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the Chamber ? Ah , sir , ask no more , ask no more of poor Dobby , stammered the elf , his eyes huge in the dark
Dark deeds are planned in this place , but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home , Harry Potter , go home
Harry Potter must not meddle in this , sir , 't is too dangerous -Who is it , Dobby ? Harry said , keeping a firm hold on Dobby's178wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again
Who 's opened it ? Who opened it last time ? Dobby ca n't , sir , Dobby ca n't , Dobby must n't tell squealed the elf
Go home , Harry Potter , go homeI 'm not going anywhere said Harry fiercely
One of my best friends is Muggle-born ; she 'll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened -Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy
So noble So valiant But he must save himself , he must , Harry Potter must not -Dobby suddenly froze , his bat ears quivering
Harry heard it , too
There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside
Dobby must go breathed the elf , terrified
There was a loud crack , and Harry 's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air
He slumped back into bed , his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer
Next moment , Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory , wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap
He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue
Professor McGonagall appeared a second later , carrying its feet
Together , they heaved it onto a bed
Get Madam Pomfrey , whispered Dumbledore , and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry 's bed out of sight
Harry lay quite still , pretending to be asleep
He heard urgent voices , and then Professor McGonagall swept back into view , closely followed by Madam Pomfrey , who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress
He heard a sharp intake of breath
What happened ? Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore , bending over the statue on the bed
l79Another attack , said Dumbledore
Minerva found him on the stairs
There was a bunch of grapes next to him , said Professor McGonagall
We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter
Harry 's stomach gave a horrible lurch
Slowly and carefully , he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed
A ray of moonlight lay across its staring face
It was Colin Creevey
His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him , holding his camera
Petrified ? whispered Madam Pomfrey
Yes , said Professor McGonagall
But I shudder to think
If Albus had n't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows what might have -The three of them stared down at Colin
Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin 's rigid grip
You do n't think he managed to get a picture of his attacker ? said Professor McGonagall eagerly
Dumbledore did n't answer
He opened the back of the camera
Good gracious said Madam Pomfrey
A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera
Harry , three beds away , caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic
Melted , said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly
What does this mean , Albus ? Professor McGonagall asked urgently
It means , said Dumbledore , that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again
Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth
Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore
who ? The question is not who , said Dumbledore , his eyes on Colin
The question is , how
And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall 's shad owy face , she did n't understand this any better than he did
CHAPTER ELEVENTHE D-KJEL ] ING C-L-IJIBHarry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff
He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin 's bed , but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday
Seeing that he was awake , Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers
All in order , she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded
When you 've finished eating , you may leave
Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower , desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby , but they were n't there
Harry left to look for them , wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they were n't interested in whether he had his bones back or not
182As Harry passed the library , Percy Weasley strolled out of it , looking in far better spirits than last time they 'd met
Oh , hello , Harry , he said
Excellent flying yesterday , really excellent
Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup you earned fifty pointsYou have n't seen Ron or Hermione , have you ? said Harry
No , I have n't , said Percy , his smile fading
I hope Ron 's not in another girls ' toilet
Harry forced a laugh , watched Percy walk out of sight , and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle 's bathroom
He could n't see why Ron and Hermione would be in there again , but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around , he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall
It 's me , he said , closing the door behind him
There was a clunk , a splash , and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione 's eye peering through the keyhole
` Harry she said
You gave us such a fright - come in how 's your arm ? Fine , said Harry , squeezing into the stall
An old cauldron was perched on the toilet , and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it
Conjuring up portable , waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione 's
We'd 've come to meet you , but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion , Ron explained as Harry , with difficulty , locked the stall again
We 've decided this is the safest place to hide it
Harry started to tell them about Colin , but Hermione interrupted
We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall tellingProfessor Flitwick this morning
That 's why we decided we 'd better get going -The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy , the better , snarled Ron
D'you know what I think ? He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match , he took it out on Colin
There 's something else , said Harry , watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion
Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night
Ron and Hermione looked up , amazed
Harry told them everything Dobby had told him - or had n't told him
Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open
The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before ? Hermione said
This settles it , said Ron in a triumphant voice
Lucius Malfoy must 've opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he 's told dear old Draco how to do it
Wish Dobby 'd told you what kind of monster 's in there , though
I want to know how come nobody 's noticed it sneaking around the school
Maybe it can make itself invisible , said Hermione , prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron
Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to be a suit of armor or something - I 've read about Chameleon Ghouls -You read too much , Hermione , said Ron , pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches
He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry
So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke yourarm He shook his head
You know what , Harry ? If he doesn'tstop trying to save your life he 's going to kill you
184The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning
The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion
The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups , as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone
Ginny Weasley , who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms , was distraught , but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up
They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues
They only stopped when Percy , apoplectic with rage , told them he was going to write to Mrs
Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares
Meanwhile , hidden from the teachers , a roaring trade in talismans , amulets , and other protective devices was sweeping the school
Neville Longbottom bought a large , evil-smelling green onion , a pointed purple crystal , and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger ; he was a pure- blood , and therefore unlikely to be attacked
They went for Filch first , Neville said , his round face fearful
And everyone knows I 'm almost a Squib
In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual , collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas
Harry , Ron , and Hermione signed her list ; they had heard that Malfoy was staying , which struck them as very suspicious
The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him
Unfortunately , the potion was only half finished
They still 3-85needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin , and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape 's private stores
Harry privately felt he 'd rather face Slytherin 's legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office
What we need , said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon 's double Potions lesson loomed nearer , is a diversion
Then one of us can sneak into Snape 's office and take what we need
Harry and Ron looked at her nervously
I think Id better do the actual stealing , Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone
You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble , and I 've got a clean record
So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so
Harry smiled feebly
Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape 's Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons
Thursday afternoon 's lesson proceeded in the usual way
Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks , on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients
Snape prowled through the fumes , making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors ' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively
Draco Malfoy , who was Snape 's favorite student , kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry , who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say Unfair
Harry 's Swelling Solution was far too runny , but he had his mind on more important things
He was waiting for Hermione 's signal , and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery186potion
When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville , Hermione caught Harry 's eye and nodded
Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron , pulled one of Fred 's Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket , and gave it a quick prod with his wand
The firework began to fizz and sputter
Knowing he had only seconds , Harry straightened up , took aim , and lobbed it into the air ; it landed right on target in Goyle 's cauldron
Goyle 's potion exploded , showering the whole class
People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them
Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon ; Goyle blundered around , his hands over his eyes , which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate - Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened
Through the confusion , Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape 's office
Silence SILENCE Snape roared
Anyone who has been splashed , come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward , his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon
As half the class lumbered up to Snape 's desk , some weighted down with arms like clubs , others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips , Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon , the front of her robes bulging
When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided , Snape swept over to Goyle 's cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework
There was a sudden hush
187If I ever find out who threw this , Snape whispered , I shall make sure that person is expelled
Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression
Snape was looking right at him , and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome
He knew it was me , Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle 's bathroom
I could tell
Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly
It 'll be ready in two weeks , she said happily
Snape ca n't prove it was you , said Ron reassuringly to Harry
What can he do ? Knowing Snape , something foul , said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled
A week later , Harry , Ron , and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board , reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up
Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over , looking excited
They 're starting a Dueling Club said Seamus
First meeting tonight I would n't mind dueling lessons ; they might come in handy one of these days
What , you reckon Slytherin 's monster can duel ? said Ron , but he , too , read the sign with interest
Could be useful , he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner
Shall we go ? Harry and Hermione were all for it , so at eight o'clock that188evening they hurried back to the Great Hall
The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall , lit by thousands of candles floating overhead
The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it , all carrying their wands and looking excited
I wonder who 'll be teaching us ? said Hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd
Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young - maybe it 'll be him
As long as it 's not - Harry began , but he ended on a groan : Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage , resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape , wearing his usual black
Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called ' Gather round , gather round Can everyone see me ? Can you all hear me ? ExcellentNow , Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club , to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full details , see my published works
Let me introduce my assistant , Professor Snape , said Lockhart , flashing a wide smile
He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin
Now , I do n't want any of you youngsters to worry - you 'll still have your Potions master when I 'm through with him , never fearWould n't it be good if they finished each other off ? Ron muttered in Harry 's ear
Snape 's upper lip was curling
Harry wondered why Lockhart189was still smiling ; if Snape had been looking at him like that he 'd have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction
Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed ; at least , Lockhart did , with much twirling of his hands , whereas Snape jerked his head irritably
Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them
As you see , we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position , Lockhart told the silent crowd
On the count of three , we will cast our first spells
Neither of us will be aiming to kill , of course
I would n't bet on that , Harry murmured , watching Snape baring his teeth
One - two - three -Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent ; Snape cried : Expelliarmus There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet : He flew backward off the stage , smashed into the wall , and slid down it to sprawl on the floor
Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered
Hermione was dancing on tiptoes
Do you think he 's all right ? she squealed through her fingers
Who cares ? said Harry and Ron together
Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet
His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end
Well , there you have it he said , tottering back onto the platform
That was a Disarming Charm - as you see , I 've lost my wand - ah , thank you , Miss Brown - yes , an excellent idea to show them that , Professor Snape , but if you do n't mind my saying190so , it was very obvious what you were about to do
If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy - however , I felt it would be instructive to let them see
Snape was looking murderous
Possibly Lockhart had noticed , because he said , Enough demonstrating I 'm going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs
Professor Snape , if you 'd like to help me -They moved through the crowd , matching up partners
Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley , but Snape reached Harry and Ron first
Time to split up the dream team , I think , he sneered
Weasley , you can partner Finnigan
Potter -Harry moved automatically toward Hermione
I do n't think so , said Snape , smiling coldly
Malfoy , come over here
Let 's see what you make of the famous Potter
And you , Miss Granger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode
Malfoy strutted over , smirking
Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who reminded Harry of a picture he 'd seen in Holidays with Hags
She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively
Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return
Face your partners called Lockhart , back on the platform
And bowHarry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads , not taking their eyes off each other
Wands at the ready shouted Lockhart
When I count to three , cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we do n't want any accidents - one
three -191Harry swung his wand high , but Malfoy had already started on two : His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he 'd been hit over the head with a saucepan
He stumbled , but everything still seemed to be working , and wasting no more time , Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted , RictusempraA jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up , wheezing
I said disarm only Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd , as Malfoy sank to his knees ; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm , and he could barely move for laughing
Harry hung back , with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor , but this was a mistake ; gasping for breath , Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry 's knees , choked , Tarantallegra and the next second Harry 's legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep
Stop Stop screamed Lockhart , but Snape took charge
Finite Incantatem he shouted ; Harry 's feet stopped dancing , Malfoy stopped laughing , and they were able to look up
A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene
Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor , panting ; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus , apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done ; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving ; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain ; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor
Harry leapt forward and pulled Millicent off
It was difficult : She was a lot bigger than he was
Dear , dear , said Lockhart , skittering through the crowd , looking at the aftermath of the duels
Up you go , Macmillan
192Careful there , Miss Fawcett
Pinch it hard , it 'll stop bleeding in a second , BootI think Id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells , said Lockhart , standing flustered in the midst of the hall
He glanced at Snape , whose black eyes glinted , and looked quickly away
Let 's have a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley , how about you -A bad idea , Professor Lockhart , said Snape , gliding over like a large and malevolent bat
Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells
We 'll be sending what 's left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox
Neville 's round , pink face went pinker
How about Malfoy and Potter ? said Snape with a twisted smile
Excellent idea said Lockhart , gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room
Now , Harry , said Lockhart
When Draco points his wand at you , you do this
He raised his own wand , attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action , and dropped it
Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up , saying , Whoops -my wand is a little overexcited -Snape moved closer to Malfoy , bent down , and whispered something in his ear
Malfoy smirked , too
Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said , Professor , could you show me that blocking thing again ? Scared ? muttered Malfoy , so that Lockhart could n't hear him
You wish , said Harry out of the corner of his mouth
Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder
Just do what I did , HarryWhat , drop my wand ? But Lockhart was n't listening
Three - two - one - go he shouted
Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed , SerpensortiaThe end of his wand exploded
Harry watched , aghast , as a long black snake shot out of it , fell heavily onto the floor between them , and raised itself , ready to strike
There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away , clearing the floor
Do n't move , Potter , said Snape lazily , clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless , eye to eye with the angry snake
I 'll get rid of it
Allow me shouted Lockhart
He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang ; the snake , instead of vanishing , flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack
Enraged , hissing furiously , it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again , fangs exposed , poised to strike
Harry was n't sure what made him do it
He was n't even aware of deciding to do it
All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake , Leave him alone And miraculously - inexplicably - the snake slumped to the floor , docile as a thick , black garden hose , its eyes now on Harry
Harry felt the fear drain out of him
He knew the snake would n't attack anyone now , though how he knew it , he could n't have explained
He looked up at Justin , grinning , expecting to see Justin looking194relieved , or puzzled , or even grateful - but certainly not angry and scared
What do you think you 're playing at ? he shouted , and before Harry could say anything , Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall
Snape stepped forward , waved his wand , and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke
Snape , too , was looking at Harry in an unexpected way : It was a shrewd and calculating look , and Harry did n't like it
He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls
Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes
Come on , said Rods voice in his ear
Move - come on -Ron steered him out of the hall , Hermione hurrying alongside them
As they went through the doors , the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something
Harry did n't have a clue what was going on , and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room
Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said , You 're a Parselmouth
Why did n't you tell us ? I 'm a what ? said Harry
` A Parselmouth said Ron
You can talk to snakesI know , said Harry
I mean , that 's only the second time I 've ever done it
I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I was a wizard -A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil ? Ron repeated faintly
195So ? said Harry
I bet loads of people here can do it
Oh , no they ca n't , said Ron
It 's not a very common gift
Harry , this is bad
What 's bad ? said Harry , starting to feel quite angry
What 's wrong with everyone ? Listen , if I had n't told that snake not to attack Justin -Oh , that 's what you said to it ? What d'you mean ? You were there - you heard me -I heard you speaking Parseltongue , said Ron
You could have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked , you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was creepy , you know -Harry gaped at him
I spoke a different language ? But - I did n't realize - how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it ? Ron shook his head
Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died
Harry could n't see what was so terrible
D'you want to tell me what 's wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin 's head ? he said
What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin does n't have to join the Headless Hunt ? It matters , said Hermione , speaking at last in a hushed voice , because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for
That 's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent
Harry 's mouth fell open
Exactly , said Ron
And now the whole school 's going to think you 're his great-great-great-great-grandson or something -But I 'm not , said Harry , with a panic he could n't quite explain
You 'll find that hard to prove , said Hermione
He lived about a thousand years ago ; for all we know , you could be
IL96 Harry lay awake for hours that night
Through a gap in the curtains around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered
Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering ? He did n't know anything about his father 's family , after all
The Dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives
Quietly , Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue
The words would n't come
It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to do it
But I 'm in Gryffindor , Harry thought
The Sorting Hat would n't have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood
Ah , said a nasty little voice in his brain , but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin , do n't you remember ? Harry turned over
He 'd see Justin the next day in Herbology and he 'd explain that he 'd been calling the snake off , not egging it on , which he thought angrily , pummeling his pillow ) any fool should have realized
By next morning , however , the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled : Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes , a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else , now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs
Norris and Colin Creevey
Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room , while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess
For heaven 's sake , Harry , said Hermione , exasperated , as one197of Ron 's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board
Go and find Justin if it 's so important to you
So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole , wondering where Justin might be
The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick , swirling gray snow at every window
Shivering , Harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place , catching snatches of what was happening within
Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who , by the sound of it , had turned his friend into a badger
Resisting the urge to take a look , Harry walked on by , thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work , and deciding to check the library first
A group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library , but they did n't seem to be working
Between the long lines of high bookshelves , Harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation
He could n't see whether Justin was among them
He was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears , and he paused to listen , hidden in the Invisibility section
So anyway , a stout boy was saying , I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory
I mean to say , if Potter 's marked him down as his next victim , it 's best if he keeps a low profile for a while
Of course , Justin 's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born
Justin actually told him he 'd been down for Eton
That 's not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin 's heir on the loose , is it ? You definitely think it is Potter , then , Ernie ? said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously
198Hannah , said the stout boy solemnly , he 's a Parselmouth
Everyone knows that 's the mark of a Dark wizard
Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes ? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue
There was some heavy murmuring at this , and Ernie went on , Remember what was written on the wall ? Enemies of the Heir , Beware
Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch
Next thing we know , Flich 's cat 's attacked
That first year , Creevey , was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match , taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud
Next thing we know - Creevey 's been attacked
He always seems so nice , though , said Hannah uncertainly , and , well , he 's the one who made You-Know-Who disappear
He ca n't be all bad , can he ? Ernie lowered his voice mysteriously , the Hufflepuffs bent closer , and Harry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie 's words
No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who
I mean to say , he was only a baby when it happened
He should have been blasted into smithereens
Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that
He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper , and said , That 's probably why You- Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place
Did n't want another Dark Lord competing with him
I wonder what other powers Potter 's been hiding ? Harry could n't take anymore
Clearing his throat loudly , he stepped out from behind the bookshelves
If he had n't been feeling so angry , he would have found the sight that greeted him funny : Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him , and the color was draining out of Ernie 's face
199Hello , said Harry
I 'm looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley
The Hufepuffs ' worst fears had clearly been confirmed
They all looked fearfully at Ernie
What do you want with him ? said Ernie in a quavering voice
I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club , said Harry
Ernie bit his white lips and then , taking a deep breath , said , We were all there
We saw what happened
Then you noticed that after I spoke to it , the snake backed off ? said Harry
All I saw , said Ernie stubbornly , though he was trembling as he spoke , was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin
I did n't chase it at him Harry said , his voice shaking with anger
It did n't even touch himIt was a very near miss , said Ernie
And in case you 're getting ideas , he added hastily , I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood 's as pure as anyone 's , so -- cc I do n't care what sort of blood you 've got said Harry fiercely
Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns ? I 've heard you hate those Muggles you live with , said Ernie swiftly
It 's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them , said Harry
Id like to see you try it
He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library , earning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince , who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook
200Harry blundered up the corridor , barely noticing where he was going , he was in such a fury
The result was that he walked into something very large and solid , which knocked him backward onto the floor
Oh , hello , Hagrid , Harry said , looking up
Hagrid 's face was entirely hidden by a woolly , snow-covered balaclava , but it could n't possibly be anyone else , as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat
A dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive , gloved hands
All righ ' , Harry ? he said , pulling up the balaclava so he could speak
Why are n't yeh in class ? Canceled , said Harry , getting up
What 're you doing in here ? Hagrid held up the limp rooster
Second one killed this term , he explained
It 's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin Bugbear , an ' I need the Headmaster 's permission ter put a charm around the hen coop
He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick , snowflecked eyebrows
Yeh sure yeh 're all righ ' ? Yeh look all hot an ' bothered -Harry could n't bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him
It 's nothing , he said
Id better get going , Hagrid , it 's Transfiguration next and I 've got to pick up my books
He walked off , his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him
Justin 's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born
2 0 IL Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor , which was particularly dark ; the torches had been extinguished by a strong , icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane
He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor
He turned to squint at what he 'd fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved
Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor , rigid and cold , a look of shock frozen on his face , his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling
And that was n't all
Next to him was another figure , the strangest sight Harry had ever seen
It was Nearly Headless Nick , no longer pearly-white and transparent , but black and smoky , floating immobile and horizontal , six inches off the floor
His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin 's
Harry got to his feet , his breathing fast and shallow , his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs
He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies
The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side
He could run , and no one would ever know he had been there
But he could n't just leave them lying here
He had to get help
Would anyone believe he had n't had anything to do with this ? As he stood there , panicking , a door right next to him opened with a bang
Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out
Why , it 's potty wee Potter cackled Peeves , knocking Harry 's glasses askew as he bounced past him
What 's Potter up to ? Why 's Potter lurking -202Peeves stopped , halfway through a midair somersault
Upside down , he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick
He flipped the right way up , filled his lungs and , before Harry could stop him , screamed , ATTACK ATTACK ANOTHER ATTACK NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE RUN FOR YOUR LIVES ATTAAAACKCrash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out
For several long minutes , there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick
Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet
Professor McGonagall came running , followed by her own class , one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair
She used her wand to set off aloud bang , which restored silence , and ordered everyone back into their classes
No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived , panting , on the scene
Caught in the act Ernie yelled , his face stark white , pointing his finger dramatically at Harry
That will do , Macmillan said Professor McGonagall sharply
Peeves was bobbing overhead , now grinning wickedly , surveying the scene ; Peeves always loved chaos
As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick , examining them , Peeves broke into song : Oh , Potter , you rotter , oh , what have you done , You 're killing off ' students , you think it 's good fun -That 's enough Peeves barked Professor McGonagall , and Peeves zoomed away backward , with his tongue out at Harry
203Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department , but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick
In the end , Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air , which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs
This Ernie did , fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft
This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together
This way , Potter , she said
Professor , said Harry at once , I swear I did n't -This is out of my hands , Potter , said Professor McGonagall curtly
They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle
Lemon drop she said
This was evidently a password , because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two
Even full of dread for what was coming , Harry could n't fail to be amazed
Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward , like an escalator
As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it , Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them
They rose upward in circles , higher and higher , until at last , slightly dizzy , Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead , with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin
He knew now where he was being taken
This must be where Dumbledore lived
204CHAPTER TWELVETHE POLYJUICE POTIONhey stepped off the stone staircase at the top , and Professor McGonagall rapped on the door
It opened silently and they entered
Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there , alone
Harry looked around
One thing was certain : of all the teachers ' offices Harry had visited so far this year , Dumbledore 's was by far the most interesting
If he had n't been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school , he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it
It was a large and beautiful circular room , full of funny little noises
A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables , whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke
The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses , all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames
There was also an enormous , claw-footed desk , and , sitting on a shelf behind it , a shabby , tattered wizard 's hat - the Sorting Hat
He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls
Surely it could n't hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again ? Just to see
just to make sure it had put him in the right HouseHe walked quietly around the desk , lifted the hat from its shelf , and lowered it slowly onto his head
It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes , just as it had done the last time he 'd put it on
Harry stared at the black inside of the hat , waiting
Then a small voice said in his ear , Bee in your bonnet , Harry Potter ? Er , yes , Harry muttered
Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask - You 've been wondering whether I put you in the right House , said the hat smartly
you were particularly difficult to place
But I stand by what I said before - Harry 's heart leapt - you would have done well in Slytherin -Harry 's stomach plummeted
He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off
It hung limply in his hand , grubby and faded
Harry pushed it back onto its shelf , feeling sick
You 're wrong , he said aloud to the still and silent hat
It did n't move
Harry backed away , watching it
Then a strange , gagging noise behind him made him wheel around
He was n't alone after all
Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey
Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back , making its gagging noise again
Harry thought it looked very ill
Its eyes were dull and , even as Harry watched , a couple more feathers fell out of its tail
Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore'spet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it , when the bird burst into flames
Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk
He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but could n't see one ; the bird , meanwhile , had become a fireball ; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering pile of ash on the floor
The office door opened
Dumbledore came in , looking very somber
Professor , Harry gasped
Your bird - I could n't do anything - he just caught fire -To Harry 's astonishment , Dumbledore smiled
About time , too , he said
He 's been looking dreadful for days ; I 've been telling him to get a move on
He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry 's face
Fawkes is a phoenix , Harry
Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes
Harry looked down in time to see a tiny , wrinkled , newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes
It was quite as ugly as the old one
It 's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day , said Dumbledore , seating himself behind his desk
He 's really very handsome most of the time , wonderful red and gold plumage
Fascinating creatures , phoenixes
They can carry immensely heavy loads , their tears have healing powers , and they make highly faithful pets
In the shock of Fawkes catching fire , Harry had forgotten what he was there for , but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settledhimself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating , light-blue stare
Before Dumbledore could speak another word , however , the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in , a wild look in his eyes , his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand
It wasn ' Harry , Professor Dumbledore said Hagrid urgently
I was talkin ' ter him seconds before that kid was found , he never had time , sir - Dumbledore tried to say something , but Hagrid went ranting on , waving the rooster around in his agitation , sending feathers everywhere
- it can't 've bin him , I 'll swear it in front o ' the Ministry o ' Magic if I have to -Hagrid , I -- yeh 've got the wrong boy , sir , I know Harry never ='Hagrid said Dumbledore loudly
I do not think that Harry attacked those people
Oh , said Hagrid , the rooster falling limply at his side
I 'll wait outside then , Headmaster
And he stomped out looking embarrassed
You do n't think it was me , Professor ? Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk
No , Harry , I do n't , said Dumbledore , though his face was somber again
But I still want to talk to you
Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him , the tips of his long fingers together
208I must ask you , Harry , whether there is anything you 'd like to tell me , he said gently
Anything at all
Harry did n't know what to say
He thought of Malfoy shouting , You 'll be next , Mudbloods and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle 's bathroom
Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said : Hearing voices no one else can hear is n't a good sign , even in the wizarding world
He thought , too , about what everyone was saying about him , and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin
No , said Harry
There is n't anything , Professor
The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic
Curiously , it was Nearly Headless Nick 's fate that seemed to worry people most
What could possibly do that to a ghost ? people asked each other ; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead ? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas
At this rate , we 'll be the only ones left , Ron told Harry and Hermione
Us , Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle
What a jolly holiday it 's going to be
Crabbe and Goyle , who always did whatever Malfoy did , had signed up to stay over the holidays , too
But Harry was glad that most people were leaving
He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors , as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison ; tired of all the muttering , pointing , and hissing as he passed
209Fred and George , however , found all this very funny
They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors , shouting , Make way for the Heir of Slytherin , seriously evil wizard coming through
Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior
It is not a laughing matter , he said coldly
Oh , get out of the way , Percy , said Fred
Harry 's in a hurry
Yeah , he 's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant , said George , chortling
Ginny did n't find it amusing either
Oh , do n't , she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next , or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met
Harry did n't mind ; it made him feel better that Fred and George , at least , thought the idea of his being Slytherin 's heir was quite ludicrous
But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy , who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it
It 's because he 's bursting to say it 's really him , said Ron knowingly
You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything , and you 're getting all the credit for his dirty work
Not for long , said Hermione in a satisfied tone
The Polyjuice Potion 's nearly ready
We 'll be getting the truth out of him any day now
At last the term ended , and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle
Harry found it peaceful , rather than gloomy , and enjoyed the fact that he , Hermione , and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower , which meant they could210play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone , and practice dueling in private
Fred , George , and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr
Percy , who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior , did n't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room
He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time
Christmas morning dawned , cold and white
Harry and Ron , the only ones left in their dormitory , were woken very early by Hermione , who burst in , fully dressed and carrying presents for them both
Wake up , she said loudly , pulling back the curtains at the window
Hermione - you 're not supposed to be in here - said Ron , shielding his eyes against the light
Merry Christmas to you , too , said Hermione , throwing him his present
I 've been up for nearly an hour , adding more lacewings to the potion
Harry sat up , suddenly wide awake
Are you sure ? Positive , said Hermione , shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron 's four-poster
If we 're going to do it , I say it should be tonight
At that moment , Hedwig swooped into the room , carrying a very small package in her beak
Hello , said Harry happily as she landed on his bed
Are you speaking to me again ? 211She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way , which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him , which turned out to be from the Dursleys
They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he 'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation , too
The rest of Harry 's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory
Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge , which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating ; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons , a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team , and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill
Harry opened the last present to find a new , hand-knitted sweater from Mrs
Weasley and a large plum cake
He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt , thinking about Mr
Weasley 's car which had n't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow ) , and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next
No one , not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later , could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts
The Great Hall looked magnificent
Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling , but enchanted snow was falling , warm and dry , from the ceiling
Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols , Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed
Percy , who had n't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read Pinhead , kept asking them all what they were sniggering at
Harry did n't even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud , snide remarks 2 : L2 about his new sweater from the Slytherin table
With a bit of luck , Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours ' time
Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening
We still need a bit of the people you 're changing into , said Hermione matter-of-facdy , as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent
And obviously , it 'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe 's and Goyle 's ; they 're Malfoys best friends , he 'll tell them anything
And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle ca n't burst in on us while we 're interrogating him
I 've got it all worked out , she went on smoothly , ignoring Harry 's and Ron 's stupefied faces
She held up two plump chocolate cakes
I 've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught
All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them
You know how greedy they are , they 're bound to eat them
Once they 're asleep , pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet
Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other
Hermione , I do n't think -That could go seriously wrong -But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had
The potion will be useless without Crabbe 's and Goyle 's hair , she said sternly
You do want to investigate Malfoy , do n't you ? Oh , all right , all right , said Harry
But what about you ? Whose hair are you ripping out ? 213I 've already got mine said Hermione brightly , pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it
Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club ? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me And she 's gone home for Christmas - so I 'll just have to tell the Slytherins I 've decided to come back
When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again , Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression
Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong ? But to Harry 's and Ron 's utter amazement , stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said
They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea , waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table , shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle
Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters
When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall , Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door
How thick can you get ? Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them
Grinning stupidly , they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths
For a moment , both of them chewed greedily , looks of triumph on their faces
Then , without the smallest change of expression , they both keeled over backward onto the floor
By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall
Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops , Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle 's fore 2 14 head and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe 's hairs
They also stole their shoes , because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet
Then , still stunned at what they had just done , they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle 's bathroom
They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron
Pulling their robes up over their faces , Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door
Hermione ? They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged , shiny- faced and looking anxious
Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling , glutinous potion
Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat
Did you get them ? Hermione asked breathlessly
Harry showed her Goyle 's hair
And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry , Hermione said , holding up a small sack
You 'll need bigger sizes once you 're Crabbe and Goyle
The three of them stared into the cauldron
Close up , the potion looked like thick , dark mud , bubbling sluggishly
I 'm sure I 've done everything right , said Hermione , nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions
It looks like the book says it should
once we 've drunk it , we 'll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves
Now what ? Ron whispered
We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs
Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses
Then , her hand trembling , she shook Millicent Bulstrode 's hair out of its bottle into the first glass
215The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly
A second later , it had turned a sick sort of yellow
Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode , said Ron , eyeing it with loathing
Bet it tastes disgusting
Add yours , then , said Hermione
Harry dropped Goyle 's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe 's into the last one
Both glasses hissed and frothed : Goyle 's turned the khaki color of a booger , Crabbe 's a dark , murky brown
Hang on , said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses
We 'd better not all drink them in here
Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we wo n't fit
And Millicent Bulstrode 's no pixie
Good thinking , said Ron , unlocking the door
We 'll take separate stalls
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion , Harry slipped into the middle stall
Ready ? he called
Ready , came Ron 's and Hermione 's voices
One - two - three -Pinching his nose , Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps
It tasted like overcooked cabbage
Immediately , his insides started writhing as though he 'd just swallowed live snakes - doubled up , he wondered whether he was going to be sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes - next , bringing him gasping to all fours , came a horrible melting feeling , as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes , his hands began to grow , the fingers thickened , the nails broadened , 2116 the knuckles were bulging like bolts -his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too smallAs suddenly as it had started , everything stopped
Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor , listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet
With difficulty , he kicked off his shoes and stood up
So this was what it felt like , being Goyle
His large hand trembling , he pulled off his old robes , which were hanging a foot above his ankles , pulled on the spare ones , and laced up Goyle 's boatlike shoes
He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles , low on his forehead
Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously did n't need them - he took them off and called , Are you two okay ? Goyle 's low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth
Yeah , came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right
Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror
Goyle stared back at him out of dull , deepset eyes
Harry scratched his ear
So did Goyle
Ron 's door opened
They stared at each other
Except that he looked pale and shocked , Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe , from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long , gorilla arms
This is unbelievable , said Ron , approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe 's flat nose
We 'd better get going , said Harry , loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle 's thick wrist
We 've still got to find out 217where the Slytherin common room is
I only hope we can find someone to follow
Ron , who had been gazing at Harry , said , You do n't know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking
He banged on Hermione 's door
C'mon , we need to go -A high-pitched voice answered him
I - I do n't think I 'm going to come after all
You go on without me
Hermione , we know Millicent Bulstrode 's ugly , no one 's going to know it 's you -No - really - I do n't think I 'll come
You two hurry up , you re wasting timeHarry looked at Ron , bewildered
That looks more like Goyle , said Ron
That 's how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question
Hermione , are you okay ? said Harry through the door
Fine - I 'm fine - go on -Harry looked at his watch
Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed
We 'll meet you back here , all right ? he said
Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully , checked that the coast was clear , and set off
Do n't swing your arms like that , Harry muttered to Ron
Eh ? Crabbe holds them sort of stiff
How 's this ? Yeah , that 's better
They went down the marble staircase
All they needed now was218a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room , but there was nobody around
Any ideas ? muttered Harry
The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there , said Ron , nodding at the entrance to the dungeons
The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long , curly hair emerged from the entrance
Excuse me , said Ron , hurrying up to her
We 've forgotten the way to our common room
I beg your pardon ? said the girl stiffly
Our common room ? I 'm a Ravenclaw
She walked away , looking suspiciously back at them
Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness , their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe 's and Goyle 's huge feet hit the floor , feeling that this was n't going to be as easy as they had hoped
The labyrinthine passages were deserted
They walked deeper and deeper under the school , constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left
After a quarter of an hour , just when they were getting desperate , they heard a sudden movement ahead
Ha said Ron excitedly
There 's one of them nowThe figure was emerging from a side room
As they hurried nearer , however , their hearts sank
It was n't a Slytherin , it was Percy
What 're you doing down here ? said Ron in surprise
Percy looked affronted
That , he said stiffly , is none of your business
It 's Crabbe , is n't it ? 2 19Wh - oh , yeah , said Ron
Well , get off to your dormitories , said Percy sternly
It 's not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days
You are , Ron pointed out
I , said Percy , drawing himself up , am a prefect
Nothing 's about to attack me
A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron
Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them , and for the first time in his life , Harry was pleased to see him
There you are , he drawled , looking at them
Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time ? I 've been looking for you ; I want to show you something really funny
Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy
And what 're you doing down here , Weasley ? he sneered
Percy looked outraged
You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect he said
I do n't like your attitudeMalfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him
Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time
He and Ron hurried after Malfoy , who said as they turned into the next passage , That Peter Weasley -Percy , Ron corrected him automatically
Whatever , said Malfoy
I 've noticed him sneaking around a lot lately
And I bet I know what he 's up to
He thinks he 's going to catch Slytherin 's heir single-handed
He gave a short , derisive laugh
Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks
Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare , damp stone wall
220 What 's the new password again ? he said to Harry
Er - said Harry
Oh , yeah -pure-blood said Malfoy , not listening , and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open
Malfoy marched through it , and Harry and Ron followed him
The Slytherin common room was a long , low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round , greenish lamps were hanging on chains
A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them , and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs
Wait here , said Malfoy to Harry and Ron , motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire
I 'll go and get it my father 's just sent it to me -Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them , Harry and Ron sat down , doing their best to look at home
Malfoy came back a minute later , holding what looked like a newspaper clipping
He thrust it under Ron 's nose
That 'll give you a laugh , he said
Harry saw Ron 's eyes widen in shock
He read the clipping quickly , gave a very forced laugh , and handed it to Harry
It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet , and it said : INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGICArthur Weasley , Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office , was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car
Lucius Malfoy , a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , where the221enchanted car crashed earlier this year , called today for Mr
Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute , Mr
Malfoy told our reporter
He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately
Weasley was unavailable for comment , although his wife told reporters to clear off or she 'd set the family ghoul on them
Well ? said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to him
Do n't you think it 's funny ? Ha , ha , said Harry bleakly
Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them , said Malfoy scornfully
You 'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods , the way they behave
Ron 's - or rather , Crabbe 's - face was contorted with fury
What 's up with you , Crabbe ? snapped Malfoy
Stomachache , Ron grunted
Well , go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me , said Malfoy , snickering
You know , I 'm surprised the Daily Prophet has n't reported all these attacks yet , he went on thoughtfully
I suppose Dumbledore 's trying to hush it all up
He 'll be sacked if it does n't stop soon
Father 's always said old Dumbledore 's the worst thing that 's ever happened to this place
He loves Muggle-borns
A decent headmaster would never 've let slime like that Creevey in
222Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin : ` Potter , can I have your picture , Potter ? Can I have your autograph ? Can I lick your shoes , please , Potter ? 'He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron
What 's the matter with you two ? Far too late , Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh , but Malfoy seemed satisfied ; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake
Saint Potter , the Mudbloods ' friend , said Malfoy slowly
He 's another one with no proper wizard feeling , or he would n't go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood
And people think he 's Slytherin 's heirHarry and Ron waited with bated breath : Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him - but thenI wish I knew who it is , said Malfoy petulantly
I could help them
Ron 's jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual
Fortunately , Malfoy did n't notice , and Harry , thinking fast , said , You must have some idea who 's behind it all
You know I have n't , Goyle , how many times do I have to tell you ? snapped Malfoy
And Father wo n't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either
Of course , it was fifty years ago , so it was before his time , but he knows all about it , and he says that it was all kept quiet and it 'll look suspicious if I know too much about it
But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened , a Mudblood died
So I bet it 's a matter of time before one of them 's killed this time
I hope it 's Granger , he said with relish
Ron was clenching Crabbe 's gigantic fists
Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy , Harry shot him a warning look and said , D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught ? Oh , yeah
whoever it was was expelled , said Malfoy
They 're probably still in Azkaban
Azkaban ? said Harry , puzzled
Azkaban - the wizard prison , Goyle , said Malfoy , looking at him in disbelief Honestly , if you were any slower , you 'd be going backward
He shifted restlessly in his chair and said , Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it
He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth , but not to get mixed up in it
Of course , he 's got a lot on his plate at the moment
You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week ? Harry tried to force Goyle 's dull face into a look of concern
Luckily , they did n't find much
Father 's got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff
But luckily , we 've got our own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor -Ho said Ron
Malfoy looked at him
So did Harry
Even his hair was turning red
His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was up , Ron was turning back into himself , and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry , he must be , too
They both jumped to their feet
Medicine for my stomach , Ron grunted , and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room , hurled themselves at the stone wall , and dashed up the passage , hoping against hope that Malfoy had n't noticed anything
Harry 224could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle 's huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank ; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall , which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they 'd locked Crabbe and Goyle
Leaving their shoes outside the closet door , they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle 's bathroom
Well , it was n't a complete waste of time , Ron panted , closing the bathroom door behind them
I know we still have n't found out who 's doing the attacks , but I 'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys ' drawing room
Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror
He was back to normal
He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione 's stall
Hermione , come out , we 've got loads to tell you -Go away Hermione squeaked
Harry and Ron looked at each other
What 's the matter ? said Ron
You must be back to normal by now , we areBut Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door
Harry had never seen her looking so happy
Ooooooh , wait till you see , she said
It 's awful-They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged , sobbing , her robes pulled up over her head
What 's up ? said Ron uncertainly
Have you still got Millicent 's nose or something ? Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink
Her face was covered in black fur
Her eyes had turned yellow and there were long , pointed ears poking through her hair
It was a c-cat hair she howled
M-Millicent Bulstrode225m-must have a cat And the p-potion is n't supposed to be used for animal transformationsUh-oh , said Ron
You 'll be teased something dreadful , said Myrtle happily
It 's okay , Hermione , said Harry quickly
We 'll take you up to the hospital wing
Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions
It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom
Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw
Wait till everyone finds out you 've got a tailermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks
There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays , because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked
So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione 's bed , to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face
Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening
When the new term started , they brought her each day 's homework
If Id sprouted whiskers , Id take a break from work , said Ron , tipping a stack of books onto Hermione 's bedside table one evening
Do n't be silly , Ron , I 've got to keep up , said Hermione briskly
Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had 21 gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown
I do n't suppose you 've got any new leads ? she added in a whisper , so that Madam Pomfrey could n't hear her
Nothing , said Harry gloomily
I was so sure it was Malfoy , said Ron , for about the hundredth time
What 's that ? asked Harry , pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione 's pillow
Just a get well card , said Hermione hastily , trying to poke it out of sight , but Ron was too quick for her
He pulled it out , flicked it open , and read aloud : To Miss Granger , wishing you a speedy recovery , from your concerned teacher , Professor Gilderoy Lockhart , Order of Merlin , Third Class , Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League , and five-time winner of Witch Weekly 's Most- Charming-Smile Award
Ron looked up at Hermione , disgusted
You sleep with this under your pillow ? But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine
Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you 've ever met , or what ? Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower
Snape had given them so much homework , Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it
Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears
That 's Filch , Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused , out of sight , listening hard
228You do n't think someone else 's been attacked ? said Ron tensely
They stood still , their heads inclined toward Flich 's voice , which sounded quite hysterical
` = even more work for me Mopping all night , like I have n't got enough to do No , this is the final straw , I 'm going to Dumbledore -His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam
They poked their heads around the corner
Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post : They were once again on the spot where Mrs
Norris had been attacked
They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about
A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor , and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle 's bathroom
Now that Filch had stopped shouting , they could hear Myrtle 's wails echoing off the bathroom walls
Now what 's up with her ? said Ron
Let 's go and see , said Harry , and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign , ignored it as always , and entered
Moaning Myrtle was crying , if possible , louder and harder than ever before
She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet
It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet
What 's up , Myrtle ? said Harry
Who 's that ? glugged Myrtle miserably
Come to throw something else at me ? Harry waded across to her stall and said , Why would I throw something at you ? 229Do n't ask me , Myrtle shouted , emerging with a wave of yet more water , which splashed onto the already sopping floor
Here I am , minding my own business , and someone thinks it 's funny to throw a book at me
But it ca n't hurt you if someone throws something at you , said Harry , reasonably
I mean , it 'd just go right through you , would n't it ? He had said the wrong thing
Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked , Let 's all throw books at Myrtle , because she ca n't feel it Ten points if you can get it through her stomach Fifty points if it goes through her head Well , ha , ha , ha What a lovely game , I do n't thinkWho threw it at you , anyway ? asked Harry
I do n't know
I was just sitting in the U-bend , thinking about death , and it fell right through the top of my head , said Myrtle , glaring at them
It 's over there , it got washed out
Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing
A small , thin book lay there
It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom
Harry stepped forward to pick it up , but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back
What ? said Harry
Are you crazy ? said Ron
It could be dangerous
Dangerous ? said Harry , laughing
Come off it , how could it be dangerous ? You 'd be surprised , said Ron , who was looking apprehensively at the book
Some of the books the Ministry 's confiscated Dad 's told me - there was one that burned your eyes out
And20everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives
And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading You just had to wander around with your nose in it , trying to do everything one-handed
And -All right , I 've got the point , said Harry
The little book lay on the floor , nondescript and soggy
Well , we wo n't find out unless we look at it , he said , and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the floor
Harry saw at once that it was a diary , and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old
He opened it eagerly
On the first page he could just make out the name T M
Riddle in smudged ink
Hang on , said Ron , who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry 's shoulder
I know that name
Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago
How on earth d'you know that ? said Harry in amazement
Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention , said Ron resentfully
That was the one I burped slugs all over
If you 'd wiped slime off a name for an hour , you 'd remember it , too
Harry peeled the wet pages apart
They were completely blank
There was n't the faintest trace of writing on any of them , not even Auntie Mabel 's birthday , or dentist , half-past three
He never wrote in it , said Harry , disappointed
I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away ? said Ron curiously
Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road , London
231 He must 've been Muggle-born , said Harry thoughtfufly
To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road
Well , it 's not much use to you , said Ron
He dropped his voice
Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle 's nose
Harry , however , pocketed it
Hermione left the hospital wing , de-whiskered , tail-less , and furfree , at the beginning of February
On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower , Harry showed her T
Riddle 's diary and told her the story of how they had found it
Oooh , it might have hidden powers , said Hermione enthusiastically , taking the diary and looking at it closely
If it has , it 's hiding them very well , said Ron
Maybe it 's shy
I do n't know why you do n't chuck it , Harry
I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it , said Harry
I would n't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either
Could 've been anything , said Ron
Maybe he got thirty O
s or saved a teacher from the giant squid
Maybe he murdered Myrtle ; that would 've done everyone a favor
But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione 's face that she was thinking what he was thinking
What ? said Ron , looking from one to the other
Well , the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago , was n't it ? he said
That 's what Malfoy said
said Ron slowly
And this diary is fifty years old , said Hermione , tapping it excitedly
Oh , Ron , wake up , snapped Hermione
We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago
We know T
Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago
Well , what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin ? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is , and how to open it , and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who 's behind the attacks this time would n't want that lying around , would they ? That 's a brilliant theory , Hermione , said Ron , with just one tiny little flaw
There 's nothing written in his diary
But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag
It might be invisible ink she whispered
She tapped the diary three times and said , ApareciumNothing happened
Undaunted , Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser
It 's a Revealer , I got it in Diagon Alley , she said
She rubbed hard on January first
I 'm telling you , there 's nothing to find in there , said Ron
Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and could n't be bothered filling it in
Harry could n't explain , even to himself , why he did n't just throw Riddle 's diary away
The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank , he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages , as though it were a story he wanted to finish
And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T
Riddle before , it still seemed to mean something to him , almost as though 233 Riddle was a friend he 'd had when he was very small , and had halfforgotten
But this was absurd
He 'd never had friends before Hogwarts , Dudley had made sure of that
Nevertheless , Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle , so next day at break , he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle 's special award , accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron , who told them he 'd seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime
Riddle 's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet
It did n't carry details of why it had been given to him Good thing , too , or it 'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it , said Ron )
However , they did find Riddle 's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit , and on a list of old Head Boys
He sounds like Percy , said Ron , wrinkling his nose in disgust
Prefect , Head Boy
probably top of every class -You say that like it 's a bad thing , said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice
The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again
Inside the castle , the mood had grown more hopeful
There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick , and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive , meaning that they were fast leaving childhood
The moment their acne clears up , they 'll be ready for repotting again , Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon
And after that , it wo n't be long until we 're cutting them up and stewing them
You 'll have Mrs
Norris back in no time
243 Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve , thought Harry
It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets , with the school so alert and suspicious
Perhaps the monster , whatever it was , was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years
Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff did n't take this cheerful view
He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one , that he had given himself away at the Dueling Club
Peeves was n't helping matters ; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing Oh , Potter , you rotter
now with a dance routine to match
Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop
Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration
I do n't think there 'll be any more trouble , Minerva , he said , tapping his nose knowingly and winking
I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time
The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him
Rather sensible to stop now , before I came down hard on him
You know , what the school needs now is a morale-booster
Wash away the memories of last term I wo n't say any more just now , but I think I know just the thing
He tapped his nose again and strode off
Lockhart 's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth
Harry had n't had much sleep because of a late- running Quidditch practice the night before , and he hurried down to the Great Hall , slightly late
He thought , for a moment , that he 'd walked through the wrong doors
The walls were all covered with large , lurid pink flowers
Worse 235still , heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling
Harry went over to the Gryffindor table , where Ron was sitting looking sickened , and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles
What 's going on ? Harry asked them , sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon
Ron pointed to the teachers ' table , apparently too disgusted to speak
Lockhart , wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations , was waving for silence
The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced
From where he sat , Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall 's cheek
Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro
Happy Valentine 's Day Lockhart shouted
And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards Yes , I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it does n't end hereLockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs
Not just any dwarfs , however
Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps
My friendly , card-carrying cupids beamed Lockhart
They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines And the fun does n't stop here I 'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion And while you 're at it , Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I 've ever met , the sly old dogProfessor Flitwick buried his face in his hands
Snape was look 236ing as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison
Please , Hermione , tell me you were n't one of the forty-six , 51 said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson
Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and did n't answer
All day long , the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines , to the annoyance of the teachers , and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms , one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry
Oy , you 'Arty Potter shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf , elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years , which happened to include Ginny Weasley , Harry tried to escape
The dwarf , however , cut his way through the crowd by kicking people 's shins , and reached him before he 'd gone two paces
I 've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person , he said , twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way
Not here , Harry hissed , trying to escape
Stay still grunted the dwarf , grabbing hold of Harry 's bag and pulling him back
Let me go Harry snarled , tugging
With a loud ripping noise , his bag split in two
His books , wand , parchment , and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything
Harry scrambled around , trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing , causing something of a holdup in the corridor
237What 's going on here ? came the cold , drawling voice of Draco Malfoy
Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag , desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine
What 's all this commotion ? said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived
Losing his head , Harry tried to make a run for it , but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor
Right , he said , sitting on Harry 's ankles
Here is your singing valentine : His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad , His hair is as dark as a blackboard
I wish he was mine , he 's really divine , The hero who conquered the Dark LordHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot
Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else , he got up , his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf , as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd , some of whom were crying with mirth
Off you go , off you go , the bell rang five minutes ago , off to class , now , he said , shooing some of the younger students away
And you , Malfoy-Harry , glancing over , saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something
Leering , he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle , and Harry realized that he 'd got Riddle 's diary
Give that back , said Harry quietly
Wonder what Potter 's written in this ? said Malfoy , who obvi 238ously had n't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry 's own diary
A hush fell over the onlookers
Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry , looking terrified
Hand it over , Malfoy , said Percy sternly
When I 've had a look , said Malfoy , waving the diary tauntingly at Harry
Percy said , As a school prefect - but Harry had lost his temper
He pulled out his wand and shouted , Expelliarmus and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart , so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air
Ron , grinning broadly , caught it
Harry said Percy loudly
No magic in the corridors
I 'll have to report this , you knowBut Harry did n't care , he was one-up on Malfoy , and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day
Malfoy was looking furious , and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom , he yelled spitefully after her , I do n't think Potter liked your valentine muchGinny covered her face with her hands and ran into class
Snarling , Ron pulled out his wand , too , but Harry pulled him away
Ron did n't need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs
It was n't until they had reached Professor Flitwick 's class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle 's diary
All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink
The diary , however , was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it
He tried to point this out to Ron , but Ron was having trouble with his wand again ; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end , and he was n't much interested in anything else
Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night
This was partly because he did n't think he could stand Fred and George singing , His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad one more time , and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle 's diary again , and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time
Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages , not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it
Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet , dipped his quill into it , and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary
The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then , as though it was being sucked into the page , vanished
Excited , Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote , My name is Harry Potter
The words shone momentarily on the page and they , too , sank without trace
Then , at last , something happened
Oozing back out of the page , in his very own ink , came words Harry had never written
Hello , Harry Potter
My name is Tom Riddle
How did you come by my diary ? These words , too , faded away , but not before Harry had started to scribble back
Someone tried to flush it down a toilet
He waited eagerly for Riddle 's reply
Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink
But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read
What do you mean ? Harry scrawled , blotting the page in his excitement
240 ` I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things
Things that were covered up
Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
That 's where I am now , Harry wrote quickly
I 'm at Hogwarts , and horrible stuff 's been happening
Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets ? His heart was hammering
Riddle 's reply came quickly , his writing becoming untidier , as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew
Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets
In my day , they told us it was a legend , that it did not exist
But this was a lie
In my fifth year , the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students , finally killing one
I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled
But the Headmaster , Professor Dippet , ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts , forbade me to tell the truth
A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident
They gave me a nice , shiny , engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut
But I knew it could happen again
The monster lived on , and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned
Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back
It 's happening again now
There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who 's behind them
Who was it last time ? I can show you , if you like , came Riddle 's reply
You do n't haveto take my word for it
I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him
Harry hesitated , his quill suspended over the diary
What did Riddle mean ? How could he be taken inside somebody else 's memory ? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory , which was 241growing dark
When he looked back at the diary , he saw fresh words forming
Let me show you
Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters
55The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind , stopping halfway through the month of June
Mouth hanging open , Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen
His hands trembling slightly , he raised the book to press his eye against the little window , and before he knew what was happening , he was tilting forward ; the window was widening , he felt his body leave his bed , and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page , into a whirl of color and shadow
He felt his feet hit solid ground , and stood , shaking , as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus
He knew immediately where he was
This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore 's office - but it was n't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk
A wizened , fraillooking wizard , bald except for a few wisps of white hair , was reading a letter by candlelight
Harry had never seen this man before
I 'm sorry , he said shakily
I did n't mean to butt in -But the wizard did n't look up
He continued to read , frowning slightly
Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered , Er - I 'll just go , shall I ? Still the wizard ignored him
He did n't seem even to have heard him
Thinking that the wizard might be deaf , Harry raised his voice
242Sorry I disturbed you
I 'll go now , he half-shouted
The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh , stood up , walked past Harry without glancing at him , and went to draw the curtains at his window
The sky outside the window was ruby-red ; it seemed to be sunset
The wizard went back to the desk , sat down , and twiddled his thumbs , watching the door
Harry looked around the office
No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions
This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it , meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster , not Dumbledore , and he , Harry , was little more than a phantom , completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago
There was a knock on the office door
Enter , said the old wizard in a feeble voice
A boy of about sixteen entered , taking off his pointed hat
A silver prefect 's badge was glinting on his chest
He was much taller than Harry , but he , too , had jet-black hair
Ah , Riddle , said the Headmaster
You wanted to see me , Professor Dippet ? said Riddle
He looked nervous
Sit down , said Dippet
I 've just been reading the letter you sent me
Oh , said Riddle
He sat down , gripping his hands together very tightly
My dear boy , said Dipper kindly , I can not possibly let you stay at school over the summer
Surely you want to go home for the holidays ? No , said Riddle at once
Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that - 243You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays , I believe ? said Dippet curiously
Yes , sir , said Riddle , reddening slightly
You are Muggle-born ? Half-blood , sir , said Riddle
Muggle father , witch mother
And are both your parents - ? My mother died just after I was born , sir
They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father , Marvolo after my grandfather
Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically
The thing is , Tom , he sighed , Special arrangements might have been made for you , but in the current circumstances
You mean all these attacks , sir ? said Riddle , and Harry 's heart leapt , and he moved closer , scared of missing anything
Precisely , said the headmaster
My dear boy , you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends
Particularly in light of the recent tragedy
the death of that poor little girl
You will be safer by far at your orphanage
As a matter of fact , the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school
We are no nearer locating the er - source of all this unpleasantness
Riddle 's eyes had widened
Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -What do you mean ? said Dippet with a squeak in his voice , sitting up in his chair
Riddle , do you mean you know something about these attacks ? No , sir , said Riddle quickly
But Harry was sure it was the same sort of no that he himself had given Dumbledore
244Dippet sank back , looking faintly disappointed
You may go , Tom
Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room
Harry followed him
Down the moving spiral staircase they went , emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor
Riddle stopped , and so did Harry , watching him
Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking
He was biting his lip , his forehead furrowed
Then , as though he had suddenly reached a decision , he hurried off , Harry gliding noiselessly behind him
They did n't see another person until they reached the entrance hall , when a tall wizard with long , sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase
What are you doing , wandering around this late , Tom ? Harry gaped at the wizard
He was none other than a fifty-year- younger Dumbledore
I had to see the headmaster , sir , said Riddle
Well , hurry off to bed , said Dumbledore , giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well
Best not to roam the corridors these days
He sighed heavily , bade Riddle good night , and strode off
Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then , moving quickly , headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons , with Harry in hot pursuit
But to Harry 's disappointment , Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape
The torches had n't been lit , and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed , Harry could only just2 45 see him , standing stock-still by the door , watching the passage outside
It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour
All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door , staring through the crack , waiting like a statue
And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present , he heard something move beyond the door
Someone was creeping along the passage
He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden
Riddle , quiet as a shadow , edged through the door and followed , Harry tiptoeing behind him , forgetting that he could n't be heard
For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps , until Riddle stopped suddenly , his head inclined in the direction of new noises
Harry heard a door creak open , and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper
got ta get yeh outta here
in the box
There was something familiar about that voice
Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner
Harry stepped out behind him
He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door , a very large box next to it
Evening , Rubeus , said Riddle sharply
The boy slammed the door shut and stood up
What yer doin ' down here , Tom ? Riddle stepped closer
It 's all over , he said
I 'm going to have to turn you in , Rubeus
They 're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks do n't stop
4 6N at d'yeh -I do n't think you meant to kill anyone
But monsters do n't make good pets
I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -It never killed no one said the large boy , backing against the closed door
From behind him , Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking
Come on , Rubeus , said Riddle , moving yet closer
The dead girl 's parents will be here tomorrow
The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered
It was n't him roared the boy , his voice echoing in the dark passage
He wouldn ' He neverStand aside , said Riddle , drawing out his wand
His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light
The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite
And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long , piercing scream unheard by anyoneA vast , low-slung , hairy body and a tangle of black legs ; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his wand again , but he was too late
The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away , tearing up the corridor and out of sight
Riddle scrambled to his feet , looking after it ; he raised his wand , but the huge boy leapt on him , seized his wand , and threw him back down , yelling , NO000000The scene whirled , the darkness became complete ; Harry felt himself falling and , with a crash , he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory , Riddle 's diary lying open on his stomach
24 7Before he had had time to regain his breath , the dormitory door opened and Ron came in
There you are , he said
Harry sat up
He was sweating and shaking
What 's up ? said Ron , looking at him with concern
It was Hagrid , Ron
Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures
During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house , and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant , three- headed dog he 'd christened Fluffy
And if , as a boy , Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle , Harry was sure he 'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it
He 'd probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long , and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs ; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it
But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody
Harry half wished he had n't found out how to work Riddle 's diary
Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount whathe 'd seen , until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long , circular conversations that followed
Riddle might have got the wrong person , said Hermione
Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people
How many monsters d'you think this place can hold ? Ron asked dully
We always knew Hagrid had been expelled , said Harry miserably
And the attacks must 've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out
Otherwise , Riddle would n't have got his award
Ron tried a different tack
Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid , anyway ? But the monster had killed someone , Ron , said Hermione
And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts , said Harry
I do n't blame him for wanting to stay here
You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley , did n't you , Harry ? He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent , said Harry quickly
The three of them fell silent
After a long pause , Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice
Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all ? That 'd be a cheerful visit , said Ron
Tell us , have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately ? 'In the end , they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack , and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice , they becamehopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled
It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified , and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker , whoever it was , had retired for good
Peeves had finally got bored of his Oh , Potter , you rotter song , Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day , and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three
This made Professor Sprout very happy
The moment they start trying to move into each other 's pots , we 'll know they 're fully mature , she told Harry
Then we 'll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing
The second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays
The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year , a matter that Hermione , at least , took very seriously
it could affect our whole future , she told Harry and Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects , marking them with checks
I just want to give up Potions , said Harry
We ca n't , said Ron gloomily
We keep all our old subjects , or I'd 've ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts
But that 's very important said Hermione , shocked
Not the way Lockhart teaches it , said Ron
I have n't learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family , all giving him different advice on what to choose
Confused and worried , he sat reading the subject lists withhis tongue poking out , asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes
Dean Thomas , who , like Harry , had grown up with Muggles , ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list , then picking the subjects it landed on
Hermione took nobody 's advice but signed up for everything
Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them
Not that he did n't get any guidance : Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience
Depends where you want to go , Harry , he said
It 's never too early to think about the future , so Id recommend Divination
People say Muggle Studies is a soft option , but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community , particularly if they 're thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father , he has to deal with Muggle business all the time
My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type , so he went for Care of Magical Creatures
Play to your strengths , Harry
But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch
In the end , he chose the same new subjects as Ron , feeling that if he was lousy at them , at least he 'd have someone friendly to help him
Gryffindor 's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff
Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner , so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework
However , the training sessions were getting better , or at leastdrier , and the evening before Saturday 's match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor 's chances for the Quidditch cup had never been better
But his cheerful mood did n't last long
At the top of the stairs to the dormitory , he met Neville Longbottom , who was looking frantic
Harry - I do n't know who did it - I just found -Watching Harry fearfully , Neville pushed open the door
The contents of Harry 's trunk had been thrown everywhere
His cloak lay ripped on the floor
The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet , the contents strewn over the mattress
Harry walked over to the bed , open-mouthed , treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls
As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed , Ron , Dean , and Seamus came in
Dean swore loudly
What happened , Harry ? No idea , said Harry
But Ron was examining Harry 's robes
All the pockets were hanging out
Someone 's been looking for something , said Ron
Is there anything missing ? Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk
It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what was n't there
Riddle 's diary 's gone , he said in an undertone to Ron
What ? Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out
They hurried down to the Gryffindor commonroom , which was half-empty , and joined Hermione , who was sitting alone , reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy
Hermione looked aghast at the news
But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our password -Exactly , said Harry
They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light , refreshing breeze
Perfect Quidditch conditions said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table , loading the team 's plates with scrambled eggs
Harry , buck up there , you need a decent breakfast
Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table , wondering if the new owner of Riddle 's diary was right in front of his eyes
Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery , but Harry did n't like the idea
He 'd have to tell a teacher all about the diary , and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago ? He did n't want to be the one who brought it all up again
As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things , another very serious worry was added to Harry 's growing list
He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet againKill this time
let me rip
He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm
The voice said Harry , -looking over his shoulder
I just heard it again - did n't you ? Ron shook his head , wide-eyed
Hermione , however , clapped a hand to her forehead
Harry - I think I 've just understood something I 've got to go to the libraryAnd she sprinted away , up the stairs
What does she understand ? said Harry distractedly , still looking around , trying to tell where the voice had come from
Loads more than I do , said Ron , shaking his head
But why 's she got to go to the library ? Because that 's what Hermione does , said Ron , shrugging
When in doubt , go to the library
Harry stood , irresolute , trying to catch the voice again , but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him , talking loudly , exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch
You 'd better get moving , said Ron
It 's nearly eleven - the match - Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower , collected his Nimbus Two Thousand , and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds , but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice , and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker
room , his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game
The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause
Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts ; Madam Hooch released the balls
The Hufflepuffs , who played in canary yellow , were standing in a huddle , having a last-minute discussion of tactics
Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching , half running across the pitch , carrying an enormous purple megaphone
Harry 's heart dropped like a stone
This match has been cancelled , Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone , addressing the packed stadium
There were boos and shouts
Oliver Wood , looking devastated , landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick
But , Professor he shouted
We 've got to play - the cupGryffindor -Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone : All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms , where their Heads of Houses will give them further information
As quickly as you can , pleaseThen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her
Potter , I think you 'd better come with me
Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time , Harry saw Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd ; he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle
To Harry 's surprise , Professor McGonagall did n't object
Yes , perhaps you 'd better come , too , Weasley
Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled ; others looked worried
Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase
But they were n't taken to anybody 's office this time
This will be a bit of a shock , said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary
There has been another attack
another double attack
Harry 's insides did a horrible somersault
Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered
Madam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long , curly hair
Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they 'd accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room
And on the bed next to her wasHermione Ron groaned
Hermione lay utterly still , her eyes open and glassy
They were found near the library , said Professor McGonagall
I do n't suppose either of you can explain this ? It was on the floor next to them
She was holding up a small , circular mirror
Harry and Ron shook their heads , both staring at Hermione
I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower , said Professor McGonagall heavily
I need to address the students in any case
All students will return to their House common rooms by six o'clock in the evening
No student is to leave the dormitories after that time
You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher
No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher
All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed
There will be no more evening activities
The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence
She rolled up the parchmentfrom which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice , I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed
It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught
I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward
She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole , and the Gryffindors began talking immediately
That 's two Gryffindors down , not counting a Gryffindor ghost , one Ravenclaw , and one Hufflepuff , said the Weasley twins ' friend Lee Jordan , counting on his fingers
Have n't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe ? Is n't it obvious all this stuff 's coming from Slytherin ? The Heir of Slytherin , the monster of Slytherin - why do n't they just chuck all the Slytherins out ? he roared , to nods and scattered applause
Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee , but for once he did n't seem keen to make his views heard
He was looking pale and stunned
Percy 's in shock , George told Harry quietly
That Ravenclaw girl - Penelope Clearwater - she 's a prefect
I do n't think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect
But Harry was only half-listening
He did n't seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione , lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone
And if the culprit was n't caught soon , he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys
Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed
Harry now knew exactly how he had felt
What 're we going to do ? said Ron quietly in Harry 's ear
D'you think they suspect Hagrid ? We 've got to go and talk to him , said Harry , making up his mind
I ca n't believe it 's him this time , but if he set the monster loose last time he 'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets , and that 's a start
But McGonagall said we 've got to stay in our tower unless we 're in class - I think , said Harry , more quietly still , it 's time to get my dad 's old cloak out again
Harry had inherited ) ust one thing from his father : a long and sil very Invisibility Cloak
It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it
They went to bed at the usual time , waited until Neville , Dean , and Sea mus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep , then got up , dressed again , and threw the cloak over themselves
The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors was n't enjoyable
Harry , who had wandered the castle at night sev eral times before , had never seen it so crowded after sunset
Teach ers , prefects , and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs , staring around for any unusual activity
Their Invisibility Cloak did n't stop them making any noise , and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape stood standing guard
Thankfully , Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore
It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open
It was a clear , starry night
They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid 's house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door
Seconds after they had knocked , Hagrid flung it open
They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them
Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him
Oh , he said , lowering the weapon and staring at them
What 're you two doin ' here ? What 's that for ? said Harry , pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside
Nothin ' - nothin ' - Hagrid muttered
I 've bin expectin ' doesn ' matter - Sit down - I 'll make tea -He hardly seemed to know what he was doing
He nearly extinguished the fire , spilling water from the kettle on it , and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand
Are you okay , Hagrid ? said Harry
Did you hear about Hermione ? Oh , I heard , all righ ' , said Hagrid , a slight break in his voice
He kept glancing nervously at the windows
He poured them both large mugs of boiling water he had forgotten to add tea bags ) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door
Hagrid dropped the fruitcake
Harry and Ron exchanged panicstricken looks , then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner
Hagrid checked that they were hidden , seized his crossbow , and flung open his door once more
Good evening , Hagrid
It was Dumbledore
He entered , looking deadly serious , and was followed by a second , very odd-looking man
The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression , and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes : a pinstriped suit , ascarlet tie , a long black cloak , and pointed purple boots
Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler
That 's Dad 's boss Ron breathed
Cornelius Fudge , the Minister of MagicHarry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up
Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty
He dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge
Bad business , Hagrid , said Fudge in rather clipped tones
Very bad business
Had to come
Four attacks on Muggle-borns
Things 've gone far enough
Ministry 's got to act
I never , said Hagrid , looking imploringly at Dumbledore
You know I never , Professor Dumbledore , sir -I want it understood , Cornelius , that Hagrid has my full confidence , said Dumbledore , frowning at Fudge
Look , Albus , said Fudge , uncomfortably
Hagrid 's record 's against him
Ministry 's got to do something - the school governors have been in touch -Yet again , Cornelius , I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest , said Dumbledore
His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before
Look at it from my point of view , said Fudge , fidgeting with his bowler
I 'm under a lot of pressure
Got to be seen to be doing something
If it turns out it was n't Hagrid , he 'll be back and no more said
But I 've got to take him
Would n't be doing my duty -Take me ? said Hagrid , who was trembling
Take me where ? For a short stretch only , said Fudge , not meeting Hagrid 's eyes
Not a punishment , Hagrid , more a precaution
If someone else is caught , you 'll be let out with a full apology -Not Azkaban ? croaked Hagrid
Before Fudge could answer , there was another loud rap on the door
Dumbledore answered it
It was Harry 's turn for an elbow in the ribs ; he 'd let out an audible gasp
Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid 's hut , swathed in a long black traveling cloak , smiling a cold and satisfied smile
Fang started to growl
Already here , Fudge , he said approvingly
What 're you doin ' here ? said Hagrid furiously
Get outta my houseMy dear man , please believe me , I have no pleasure at all in being inside your - er - d'you call this a house ? said Lucius Malfoy , sneering as he looked around the small cabin
I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here
And what exactly did you want with me , Lucius ? said Dumbledore
He spoke politely , but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes
Dreadful thing , Dumbledore , said Malfoy lazily , taking out a long roll of parchment , but the governors feel it 's time for you to step aside
This is an Order of Suspension - you 'll find all twelve signatures on it
I 'm afraid we feel you 're losing your touch
How many attacks have there been now ? Two more this afternoon , was n't it ? At this rate , there 'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts , and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school
Oh , now , see here , Lucius , said Fudge , looking alarmed , Dumbledore suspended - no , no - last thing we want just now262The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors , Fudge , said Mr
And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -See here , Malfoy , if Dumbledore ca n't stop them , said Fudge , whose upper lip was sweating now , I mean to say , who can ? That remains to be seen , said Mr
Malfoy with a nasty smile
But as all twelve of us have voted -Hagrid leapt to his feet , his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling
'An ' how many did yeh have ter threaten an ' blackmail before they agreed , Malfoy , eh ? he roared
Dear , dear , you know , that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days , Hagrid , said Mr
I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that
They wo n't like it at all
Yeh can ' take Dumbledore yelled Hagrid , making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket
Take him away , an ' the Muggle-borns won ' stand a chance There 'll be killin ' nextCalm yourself , Hagrid , said Dumbledore sharply
He looked at Lucius Malfoy
If the governors want my removal , Lucius , I shall of course step aside -But - stuttered Fudge
Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy 's cold gray ones
However , said Dumbledore , speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word , you will find that I will 26ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle ; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses
But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows , striding the grounds with Fang at his heels , the scene did n't look right to Harry ; no better , in fact , than the inside of the castle , where things were so horribly wrong
Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione , but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing
We 're taking no more chances , Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door
No , I 'm sorry , there 's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off
With Dumbledore gone , fear had spread as never before , so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows
There was barely a face to be seen in the school 265that did n't look worried and tense , and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled
Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore 's final words to himself I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me
Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it
But what good were these words ? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help , when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were ? Hagrid 's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was , there did n't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow
Harry looked everywhere he went , helped rather reluctantly ) by Ron
They were hampered , of course , by the fact that they were n't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors
Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers , but Harry found it very irksome
One person , however , seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion
Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy
Harry did n't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left , when , sitting right behind Malfoy , Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle
I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore , he said , not troubling to keep his voice down
I told you he thinks Dumbledore 's the worst headmaster the school 's ever266had
Maybe we 'll get a decent headmaster now
Someone who wo n't want the Chamber of Secrets closed
McGonagall wo n't last long , she 's only filling in
Snape swept past Harry , making no comment about Hermione 's empty seat and cauldron
Sir , said Malfoy loudly
Sir , why do n't you apply for the headmaster 's job ? Now , now , Malfoy , said Snape , though he could n't suppress a thin- lipped smile
Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors
I daresay he 'll be back with us soon enough
Yeah , right , said Malfoy , smirking
I expect you 'd have Father 's vote , sir , if you wanted to apply for the job - I 'll tell Father you 're the best teacher here , sir -Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon , fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan , who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron
I 'm quite surprised the Mudbloods have n't all packed their bags by now , Malfoy went on
Bet you five Galleons the next one dies
Pity it was n't Granger -The bell rang at that moment , which was lucky ; at Malfoy 's last words , Ron had leapt off his stool , and in the scramble to collect bags and books , his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed
Let me at him , Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms
I do n't care , I do n't need my wand , I 'm going to kill him with my bare hands -Hurry up , I 've got to take you all to Herbology , barked Snape over the class 's heads , and off they marched , with Harry , Ron , and Dean bringing up the rear , Ron still trying to get loose
It was only 261safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses
The Herbology class was very subdued ; there were now two missing from their number , Justin and Hermione
Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs
Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan
Ernie took a deep breath and said , very formally , I just want to say , Harry , that I 'm sorry I ever suspected you
I know you 'd never attack Hermione Granger , and I apologize for all the stuff I said
We 're all in the same boat now , and , well -He held out a pudgy hand , and Harry shook it
Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron
That Draco Malfoy character , said Ernie , breaking off dead twigs , he seems very pleased about all this , does n't he ? D'you know , I think he might be Slytherin 's heir
That 's clever of you , said Ron , who did n't seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry
Do you think it 's Malfoy , Harry ? Ernie asked
No , said Harry , so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared
A second later , Harry spotted something
Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass , moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting
Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears
Ouch What 're you -268Harry pointed out the spiders , following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun
Oh , yeah , said Ron , trying , and failing , to look pleased
But we ca n't follow them now -Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously
Harry 's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders
If they pursued their fixed course , there could be no doubt about where they would end up
Looks like they 're heading for the Forbidden Forest
And Ron looked even unhappier about that
At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson
Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot
We 'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again , Harry told Ron
We can take Fang with us
He 's used to going into the forest with Hagrid , he might be some help
Right , said Ron , who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers
Er - are n't there - are n't there supposed to be werewolves in the forest ? he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart 's classroom
Preferring not to answer that question , Harry said , There are good things in there , too
The centaurs are all right , and the unicorns
Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before
Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again
Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him
Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual , but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant
2 69Come now , he cried , beaming around him
Why all these long faces ? People swapped exasperated looks , but nobody answered
Do n't you people realize , said Lockhart , speaking slowly , as though they were all a bit dim , the danger has passed The culprit has been taken away -Says who ? said Dean Thomas loudly
My dear young man , the Minister of Magic would n't have taken Hagrid if he had n't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty , said Lockhart , in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two
Oh , yes he would , said Ron , even more loudly than Dean
I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid 's arrest than you do , Mr
Weasley , said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone
Ron started to say that he did n't think so , somehow , but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk
We were n't there , remember ? Harry muttered
But Lockhart 's disgusting cheeriness , his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good , his confidence that the whole business was now at an end , irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart 's stupid face
Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron : Let 's do it tonight
Ron read the message , swallowed hard , and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione
The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve , and he nodded
The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days , because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had no -270where else to go
They also had plenty to talk about , with the result that the common room often did n't empty until past midnight
Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner , and spent the evening sitting on it , waiting for the room to clear
Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap , and Ginny sat watching them , very subdued in Hermione 's usual chair
Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose , trying to finish the games quickly , but even so , it was well past midnight when Fred , George , and Ginny finally went to bed
Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak , throwing it over themselves , and climbing through the portrait hole
It was another difficult journey through the castle , dodging all the teachers
At last they reached the entrance hall , slid back the lock on the oak front doors , squeezed between them , trying to stop any creaking , and stepped out into the moonlit grounds
'Course , said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass , we might get to the forest and find there 's nothing to follow
Those spiders might not 've been going there at all
I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction , but
His voice trailed away hopefully
They reached Hagrid 's house , sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows
When Harry pushed the door open , Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them
Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep , booming barks , they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece , which glued his teeth together
Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid 's table
There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest
21 : L C'mon , Fang , we 're going for a walk , said Harry , patting his leg , and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them , dashed to the edge of the forest , and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree
Harry took out his wand , murmured , Lumos and a tiny light appeared at the end of it , just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders
Good thinking , said Ron
Id light mine , too , but you know - it 'd probably blow up or something
Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder , pointing at the grass
Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees
Okay , Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst , I 'm ready
So , with Fang scampering around them , sniffing tree roots and leaves , they entered the forest
By the glow of Harry 's wand , they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path
They walked behind them for about twenty minutes , not speaking , listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves
Then , when the trees had become thicker than ever , so that the stars overhead were no longer visible , and Harry 's wand shone alone in the sea of dark , they saw their spider guides leaving the path
Harry paused , trying to see where the spiders were going , but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black
He had never been this deep into the forest before
He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he 'd been in here
But Hagrid was miles away now , probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban , and he had also said to follow the spiders
2-V2 Something wet touched Harry 's hand and he jumped backward , crushing Rods foot , but it was only Fang 's nose
What d'you reckon ? Harry said to Ron , whose eyes he could just make out , reflecting the light from his wand
We 've come this far , said Ron
So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees
They could n't move very quickly now ; there were tree roots and stumps in their way , barely visible in the near blackness
Harry could feel Fang 's hot breath on his hand
More than once , they had to stop , so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight
They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour , their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles
After a while , they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward , though the trees were as thick as ever
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great , echoing bark , making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins
What ? said Ron loudly , looking around into the pitch-dark , and gripping Harry 's elbow very hard
There 's something moving over there , Harry breathed
sounds like something big
Some distance to their right , the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees
Oh , no , said Ron
Oh , no , oh , no , oh -Shut up , said Harry frantically
It 'll hear you
Hear me ? said Ron in an unnaturally high voice
It 's already heard FangThe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they 273stood , terrified , waiting
There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence
What d'you think it 's doing ? said Harry
Probably getting ready to pounce , said Ron
They waited , shivering , hardly daring to move
D'you think it 's gone ? Harry whispered
Dunno -Then , to their right , came a sudden blaze of light , so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes
Fang yelped and tried to run , but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder
Harry Ron shouted , his voice breaking with relief Harry , it 's our carWhat ? Come onHarry blundered after Ron toward the light , stumbling and tripping , and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing
Weasley 's car was standing , empty , in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches , its headlights ablaze
As Ron walked , open-mouthed , toward it , it moved slowly toward him , exactly like a large , turquoise dog greeting its owner
It 's been here all the time said Ron delightedly , walking around the car
Look at it
The forest 's turned it wild
The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud
Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own
Fang did n't seem at all keen on it ; he kept close to Harry , who could feel him quivering
His breathing slowing down again , Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes
214And we thought it was going to attack us said Ron , leaning against the car and patting it
I wondered where it had goneHarry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders , but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights
We 've lost the trail , he said
C'mon , let 's go and find them
Ron did n't speak
He did n't move
His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor , right behind Harry
His face was livid with terror
Harry did n't even have time to turn around
There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground , so that he was hanging facedown
