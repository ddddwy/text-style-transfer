It is my mission to help you lose weight , feel better , look better and live a healthy and happy long life . You ca n't do those things if you are overweight and in denial about it . Your weight is ultimately something you can control . I 'd like to help you do just that .
External controls never work long term . Eventually , we get fed up and rebel . Only an internal change can become a way of life . So how do we achieve an internal shift that will help us obtain and maintain our ideal weight ?
I learned that this struggle to break from a routine -- to find passion in what you do , to find your voice -- is something we all go through . There is something reassuring , beautiful even , in how human this is .
Even if you 're completely dissatisfied with your present job , stop focusing on why you 're getting away with this deliberate defiance . That 's irrelevant . Figure out the why in what you are actually doing . That is what 's important .
There 's no better way to see the ebb and flow in the worldof aviation than to go back and review the events of the past year . As I look at what I saw fit to write about in 2012 , I appreciate the unconventional approach some airlines have taken in response to the rapid changes in the industry .
Last year was the first year I chose a word instead of setting a plethora of goals or resolutions . It was about choosing a primary focus for the next 52 weeks of my life . Sure , I still set personal and professional goals , but having that guiding word made a huge difference .
Divorce is n't the end of your life . Get out , forget the lawyers and the paperwork for a while , and have fun with people who really care about you .
The same life energy that leads to suffering also provides the fuel for profound awakening . Desire becomes a problem only when it takes over our sense of who we are .
We know that this is an extremely complex issue and by no means think that simple solutions can adequately address such complex problems . If you have a son or daughter who is struggling , isolated and angry , here are some words that you might consider writing or saying .
Yoga for kids looks very different from even the beginner yoga varieties designed for adults . Yes , we want them to learn to breathe , stretch and strengthen their bodies and relax . But techniques for teaching adults often fail to engage children , who have much shorter attention spans .
The past few years have seen Japanese food becoming one of many people 's favorite cuisines and it 's certainly not because of Americanized , watered down dishes . Izakaya fare is quickly becoming the new definition of Japanese food , so what exactly is Izakaya ?
Sofia Vergara , Jennifer Aniston and more celebrities have been spotted on the beach in stunning swimwear this holiday season
So here I am , waiting for the arthroscopy that will cut away the torn meniscus of my other knee and advance me toward premature arthritis . I should have seen that beyond the end of the long jump sand pit , but I did n't . I am using this week of waiting to reflect upon my changed condition .
When we talk about a collective shift , we are talking about an awakening of our collective consciousness . And even though there are not yet massive indications of that happening out there in the world , it is happening as an inside job , within those who are ready to awaken .
When I went to a Borders bookstore for the first time , I found a book on birth mothers . I was shocked . I did n't even know

Today , 120 years after you offered testimony about black progress and an acute prognosis of America 's condition , I wonder : Are the advancements of black people in this nation the best measures for progress ?
I exist in the world today because you prevailed . I remember hearing and reading the rich stories of triumph , but now I wonder what selfless leaders like Harriet Tubman , or visionaries like Frederick Douglass , might think if they were to look down upon America the beautiful , today .

The truth is , things are not perfect for black folks today , but we have so much potential . I believe in our people so much . I believe in our call to greatness .
I believe there is so much we can learn from you -- mainly the evils of complacency . What will future generations say about us at the 300th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation if we are complacent with just having an African American in the White House ?
We can even flash forward to another famous speech when it was declared that 'all men are created equal ' and ask ourselves : Does this include the voices of those who identify as black and gay ?

Dead are the days when Blacks had no voice . Race is no longer a defining limitation in how we choose to love , marry or serve our country . We are the future we 've been waiting . But as you may have wisely anticipated , the struggle for equality continues .

There 's something about travel -- whether you 're flying , driving or sailing -- that brings out the jerk in all of us .

Like a mythical shapeshifter or a repertory actor , Mitt Romney will pretend to be whatever you need . Politicians often do this , but he reaches new heights of brazenness . Time and again he says something on the stump that a campaign spokesperson later clarifies .
